Baelish,Sansa is confused and horrified , but Baelish promises to keep her safe .

Baelish,She doubts Baelish 's ability to protect her or even himself , threatening to have Brienne kill him .
Baelish,She points out that Baelish has offered to help Sansa for nothing in return , which probably means that he 's after something .
Baelish,She responds by threatening his life in a demonstration of her control over her guards , ordering them to first seize Baelish and cut his throat and almost immediately rescinding the order .
Baelish,There is only one reason Baelish could be taking her there - he means to return her to Winterfell , straight into the arms of the Boltons .
Baelish,This disturbs Sansa , but she thinks it is simply impossible , as Baelish is so much older than her .
Baelish,To add fuel to the fire , Baelish adds that marrying the last remaining Stark gives the Boltons a stronger hold over the North than an alliance with a hated southern house .

Baelish,While watching Robin spar , Sansa witnesses Baelish receive a message , which he quickly hides .

Balon,Theon implores his father to reconsider , claiming that if the Greyjoys attack the North , they face the possibility of total destruction if they lose , but if they ally with the Starks and win , Balon will be crowned King of the Iron Islands and House Greyjoy will be awarded Casterly Rock and essentially the source of the Lannisters ' wealth along with it , but Balon rebuffs Theon and chastises him for becoming loyal to the Starks .
Balon,To her surprise , Euron admits killing Balon but then defends his actions on the grounds that Balon was leading them to defeat in the North .

Balon,When Theon warns his father that he will not defeat the Lannisters , Balon retorts that he has no intention of fighting the Lannisters .

Balon King of the Iron Islands,He delivers Robb Stark 's letter suggesting an alliance against House Lannister , for which Robb will make Balon King of the Iron Islands again .
Bank,Cersei suggests coming to some arrangement with one of their representatives , but Tywin dismisses the idea , since the Bank is a monolithic structure that can not be avoided , lied to or swayed .

Baratheon,Consulting the book 's entry on House Baratheon , Lord Eddard finds that every time a Baratheon has married , the children have had black hair ... right up to Cersei and Robert 's children , who are all blond .
Baratheon,Elsewhere , Ramsay finishes off the few remaining Baratheon soldiers and heads back to Winterfell .
Baratheon,Jaime deduces that Brienne is n't from the North because he would have noticed her at Winterfell when he visited there , so ( as she is from House Tarth ) she must be a Baratheon supporter .
Baratheon,Over time they were joined by Stark deserters , Baratheon deserters , and commoners who want to defend their homes .

Baratheon,Tommen Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell are wed , much to the dismay of Cersei .
Baratheons,Both Stannis and Renly have claimed the Iron Throne , meaning the Lannisters are now faced with fighting a two-front war against the Starks to the north and the Baratheons to the south .
Baratheons,Robb and Brynden , however , are furious with Edmure : their grand strategy was to lure Tywin and Gregor's armies into the Westerlands , where they would be vulnerable , out of position , and unable to defend the capital against the Baratheons .
Baratheons,Tywin states that this will confirm that the Vale of Arryn , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support Robb Stark , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies ( other marriage alliances , with House Tyrell of the Reach and House Martell of Dorne , combined with the crushing of the Baratheons , have in turn secured the rest of southern Westeros under Lannister control ) .

Barristan,Aware of his dislike of politics , Daenerys asks if Barristan wants to attend her in the throne room ; after being assured that Daario has her back , she gives him the day off , cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below .
Barristan,Daenerys , Jorah and Barristan hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the Second Sons , a professional mercenary company , the `` powerful friends '' the Yunkish have employed .
Barristan,Daenerys tells Barristan to organize a meeting with the Second Sons ' captains , saying that men who fight for gold `` ca n't afford to lose to a girl . ''
Barristan,Grey Worm , Jorah and Barristan all volunteer to stand as her champion ; she refuses all three as too valuable to her .
Barristan,Grey Worm staggers over Barristan , but he has lost consciousness .
Barristan,However , Barristan explains that as a former Kingsguard member under Aerys Targaryen , and one who 'd killed several of Robert 's friends , while Robert did n't mind keeping him in his position as a guard , he never really trusted his advice , so he left him out of Small Council meetings .
Barristan,It becomes apparent that Jorah is trying to figure out if Barristan knew that Jorah was initially a spy for King Robert , reporting back to Varys .
Barristan,Jorah and Barristan briefly bicker about the fact that Barristan only just came to them , while Jorah was defending Daenerys from Robert Baratheon 's assassins for months , and Barristan is n't Lord Commander here ; Jorah takes his orders from Daenerys .
Barristan,Jorah and Barristan continue to disagree on whether or not Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied .
Barristan,Jorah begs to be allowed to speak with her privately , but Barristan tells him that he will never be alone with her again .
Barristan,Jorah insists that it is their only chance to get an army , but Barristan believes this is not the honorable way , as slavery is illegal and abhorred in the Seven Kingdoms .

Boltons,Realizing this is true , Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer : if he leaves the Night 's Watch , Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell , so he can rally the North to Stannis 's side and resume the fight against the Boltons , Freys , and Lannisters .

Boltons,Sansa will be alone with the Boltons but he explains his plan to her : Stannis will have to attack the Boltons soon if he is to beat the winter snows , and he bets that Stannis will probably win , because he is one of the best military commanders in all of Westeros , and the Boltons will be outnumbered by Stannis , as the other northern houses would be quick to betray their liege lord .
Boltons,Smalljon has come to forge an alliance with the Boltons against Jon Snow and the Wildlings .
Boltons,Stannis asks how this could happen and Davos insists that the Boltons know the North 's terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp .
Boltons,The Boltons greet Sansa and Baelish At Winterfell itself , the Boltons and their households greet Sansa and Littlefinger .

Bran,Inside Bran 's vision , Wylis notices Bran , who links the present Hodor to the past Wylis .
Bran,Jojen Reed clarifies that Summer was eating and that what Bran can not gain sustenance from what Summer eats .
Bran,Jojen advises Bran that he must follow the raven , and when he is confused , Jojen points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree .
Bran,Jojen and Meera also caution Bran that warging so long is dangerous for other reasons .
Bran,Jojen confirms that Bran 's dream of his father Eddard the day he died was an example of the Sight , and that Jojen himself had a similar dream the same day .
Bran,Jojen confirms that Bran was n't simply experiencing a vision of Jojen in his earlier dream , but that he reached out with his mind to contact Bran in his dream , and that he remembers seeing the three-eyed raven too .
Bran,Jojen explains that Bran himself is a warg .
Bran,Jojen then tells Bran that in his vision he saw Jon Snow with the wildlings .
Bran,Jon secures volunteers while Bran , Jojen , Meera and Hodor stumble on shelter .
Bran,Jon then says goodbye to the comatose Bran , before departing at his stepmother 's cold request .
Bran,Just as all seems lost , the wights around Bran suddenly burst into fireballs , and he hears a young girl 's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree .
Bran,Karl does so when Bran reveals his true identity .
Bran,Later , Bran is the only one in the cave awake and is anxious to warg back into the Weirwood tree .
Bran,Later that night , Bran is awoken by a sound , and wakes his companions in time to see something large climbing out of the castle well ; Meera attacks and overpowers the intruder , who is revealed to be Samwell Tarly , accompanied by Gilly .
Bran,Luwin urges her not to tell Bran and Rickon about the children Theon had murdered , but Bran is sitting up behind a corner and listening to them .
Bran,Making their way out , Osha is still trying to tell Bran that it could be a coincidence , but outside they see Maester Luwin , who holds a letter and looks at them with such sadness that it is obviously the news of Eddard 's death .
Bran,Meanwhile , Bronn gives a lesson to an unlikely pupil ; Bran 's vision helps map out his journey ; Stannis loses patience with Davos ; and Ramsay takes a perverse delight in his new pet .
Bran,Meanwhile , Samwell Tarly is fretting about Gilly 's safety in Mole 's Town with the wildlings loose , and it is revealed that Sam told Jon about Bran still being alive and north of the wall .
Bran,Meera Reed , sensing danger , urges them to move on , but Bran insists on trying to free Ghost and Summer ; before they can , however , they are taken prisoner by the mutineers .
Bran,Meera desperately tries to get Bran out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened Hodor to carry Bran away to no avail .
Bran,Meera grabs Bran 's sled and tells Hodor to bar the exit , shouting to `` Hold the door ! `` .
Bran,Meera is upset that her brother died to reach him , but the Three-eyed Raven says that Jojen ( who possessed the Greensight , as Bran does ) always knew that he would die helping Bran arrive here , but that he came nonetheless .
Bran,Meera runs to the cave entrance along with Bran , Hodor , and Summer while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights .
Bran,Nearby , Bran Stark and his companions hear the child 's cries ; warging into Summer , Bran goes to investigate , but Summer falls into a trap just outside Craster 's Keep .
Bran,Ned looks back for a second , seemingly hearing Bran , but then runs into the Tower .
Bran,Old Nan , the oldest servant in the castle , tells Bran stories to pass the time , but he does n't want her usual heroic stories about the likes of Ser Duncan the Tall .
Bran,Old Nan tells Bran of winter and the Long Night .
Bran,Osha frees Bran , Rickon Stark , Hodor , and their direwolves , Summer and Shaggydog , smuggling them out of the castle and killing one of Theon 's guards in the process .
Bran,Osha promises to look after Rickon and orders the Reed siblings to do the same with Bran before she , Rickon , and Shaggydog depart in the dead of night .
Bran,Osha takes Bran down there , and Bran tells her about the histories of some of the ancestors entombed there .
Bran,Outside the tree , Bran finds Meera Reed , who still appears to be in mourning over her brother 's death .
Bran,Present-day Hodor braces himself against the door long enough for Meera to disappear into the snow with Bran 's unconscious body on the sled .
Bran,Ramsay reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to House Stark 's rule of the North following Robb Stark 's death , and nearly all the Northerners , who are furious at House Bolton and House Frey 's treachery against the Starks , will rally behind Bran and Rickon rather than Roose if they learn the boys are alive .
Bran,Ravens arrive at King 's Landing with news of Bran 's recovery .
Bran,Robb finds a group of wildlings threatening Bran and trying to steal his horse .
Bran,Robb kills two , but another wildling holds Bran with a knife to the throat .
Bran,Robb receives the letter and interrogates the captive Jaime about his reasons for crippling Bran .
Bran,Robb says farewell to Bran and to Rickon , who is convinced he 'll see neither Robb nor his parents again .
Bran,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Bran,Sam quickly deduces Bran 's identity by recognizing Bran 's direwolf and Hodor .
Bran,Several images rush to Bran 's mind , including swarms of crows , wights ( both human and horses ) , and the fall that paralyzed him .
Bran,She is horrified at the thought that Bran and Rickon were in danger while she was away and could not protect them , and are now likely dead .
Bran,She offers to pray for Bran 's survival , hoping that this time the gods will listen .
Bran,She summons Robb , Theon , Luwin and the castle master at arms , Ser Rodrik Cassel and tells them that she suspects that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran because he might have seen something in the tower .
Bran,She tearfully wonders if her sons Bran and Rickon similarly watched at Winterfell for her return when she failed to arrive to save them .
Bran,Some time later , Bran , Rickon , Osha and Hodor emerge from their hiding place in Winterfell 's crypts and find the castle burning .
Bran,Stiv and Osha accost Bran near Winterfell .
Bran,That night Bran asks Osha to take Rickon ( who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to Bran or Robb ) to Last Hearth , the home of House Umber , while he , Meera and Jojen head through the Wall in search of the Three-eyed raven .
Bran,The Greatjon roars with laughter and accepts Robb 's commands , much to the shock of Bran , who witnessed the entire incident .
Bran,The Hodor in the cave puts Bran 's body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with Leaf and Meera , as Bran 's direwolf Summer is killed attacking the wights .
Bran,The Three-eyed Raven shows Bran a vision of a heart tree amid spirals of standing stones in a lush green valley .
Bran,The Three-eyed Raven tells Bran , Meera and Hodor that the Night King is now able to locate Bran and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the White Walkers and the wights out of the cave .
Bran,The Three-eyed raven replies that Bran will never walk again , `` but you will fly . ''
Bran,The boy is surprised , and Theon explains to him that Bran and Rickon escaped , so he had to fake their deaths so he would n't seem weak .
Bran,The boy tells Bran that he can not shoot the raven , because he is the raven .
Bran,The groups then head in different directions ; Sam and Gilly for Castle Black , and the Reeds , Hodor , and Bran beyond the Wall .
Bran,The raven further states that he 's waited a thousand years for Bran to arrive , and that Bran will not share the raven 's destiny .
Bran,Theon Greyjoy summons Hodor , the castle 's dim-witted stableboy , who can only say the word `` Hodor '' , to help carry Bran down to the great hall , where Robb Stark is hosting a meeting with Tyrion Lannister and Yoren , both traveling down from the Wall to King 's Landing together .
Bran,Theon approaches Bran , then takes over Winterfell .
Bran,Theon even apologizes aloud for having two innocent orphan boys killed , so in desperation he could pass them off as Bran and Rickon Stark .
Bran,Theon shoots him from behind , angering Robb by endangering Bran .
Bran,There has been no sighting of Bran or Rickon , and though Robb hopes that they are still alive , there is a strong possibility that they are dead .
Bran,There is then a fire in part of the castle , but this proves to be a distraction to allow an assassin to attempt to finish off Bran .
Bran,They are interrupted by Hodor who was bathing and has forgotten to put his clothes back on , and Osha remarks that he might have giant blood in him before Bran sends him away .
Bran,They discover that Bran has wandered off on his horse and go looking for him .
Bran,Though Bran wants to stay , he is dragged out of the vision by the Three-Eyed Raven , who warns him that it is dangerous to stay too long in such visions .
Bran,Though Meera questions the point of her presence during Bran 's training , Leaf states that Bran will need her when he leaves the tree .
Bran,Two of Eddard 's trueborn sons , 17-year-old Robb and 10-year-old Bran , accompany him to the execution along with his bastard son Jon Snow , his ward , Theon Greyjoy , the master-at-arms Rodrik Cassel and his leading guard Jory Cassel .
Bran,Tyrion Lannister stops at Winterfell on his way back to King 's Landing and gets a frosty reception from Robb Stark , despite an act of kindness for Bran .
Bran,Tyrion also protests his innocence in the attempt on Bran 's life and points out he 'd have to be an idiot to give the assassin his own blade .
Bran,Tyrion speaks with Bran .
Bran,Using a dragonglass-tipped spear , Meera kills the first White Walker that enters , and fights alongside the remaining Children of the Forest to try to fend off the wights until Bran wakes up .
Bran,When Bran arrives , Tyrion sympathizes with Bran for being a cripple , which annoys Bran , as does asking him if he likes to ride , but Tyrion simply says it is the truth , no less so for being a hard truth .
Bran,When Bran asks his father about Will 's talk of White Walkers , Eddard dismisses it as a madman 's ramblings , insisting that the Walkers have been gone for centuries .
Bran,When Bran asks who she is , she replies that `` the First Men called us 'the Children , but we were born long before them . ''
Bran,When Bran replies `` ten , '' Jaime remarks with a sigh , `` The things I do for love . ''
Bran,When Robb pays a visit , Bran asks his brother if it is true that his legs are crushed and that he will never walk again .
Bran,When they are on the move again , Jojen and Bran discuss his wolf-dreams .
Bran,While around the fire Bran tells the story of the Rat Cook , a Night 's Watch member who killed a guest under his roof , a sin the gods can not forgive .
Bran,While in the mill , Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall , before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby .
Bran,While still in the vision , Bran hears Meera 's cries to warg into Hodor and the Three-eyed Raven tells him to listen to her .
Bran,While the Three-eyed Raven and Bran are still sharing a vision , the Night King kills the Three-Eyed Raven , and his figure within Bran 's vision blows away as ashes and rags .
Bran,Wights begin to swarm the cave , killing all of the Children of the Forest except for Leaf , as Meera starts yelling at Bran to warg into Hodor .
Bran,With Bran looking on beseechingly , Eddard agrees that his children should have the pups , but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants .
Bran,With some difficulty Hodor pushes the door open and pulls Bran through , coming back to help Meera close the door just as the wights approach .
Bran,With that , he pushes Bran out of the window .
Bran,Young Bran witnesses an execution for the first time without flinching , earning praise from Jon .
Bran,to present-day Hodor , within Bran 's vision Wylis falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure .
Bran Stark,At Craster 's Keep , Locke scouts the keep for the party of the Night 's Watch sent to eliminate the traitors holed up there ; in his reconnaissance , Locke finds the hut where Bran Stark , Jojen , Meera and Hodor are being held captive .
Bran Stark,At Winterfell , Bran Stark suffers through the petty complaints of his vassals , facing unrest at Robb Stark calling his banners and taking the young men south .
Bran Stark,At Winterfell , now held by the ironborn , Theon Greyjoy awakens to find that Osha is gone and she has escaped with Hodor , Bran Stark , Rickon Stark and their direwolves .
Bran Stark,Far to the north , Bran Stark and the Reed children continue their journey to find the Three-eyed raven , though they are on the brink of exhaustion .
Bran Stark,In The North , on their way to the Wall , Bran Stark 's party makes camp .
Bran Stark,In Winterfell , Bran Stark has a nightmare in which he sees a three-eyed raven , sitting on one of the stone direwolves outside the doorway to the Stark crypts .
Bran Stark,In Winterfell , Bran Stark lies unconscious and badly wounded , his mother by his side .
Bran Stark,In the North , Bran Stark is having a shared greensight dream with Jojen Reed .
Bran Stark,In the North , tensions rise at camp between Osha and Meera Reed before Bran Stark diffuses the situation .
Bran Stark,Just as the figure makes its kill , it is revealed that the figure is Summer and that Bran Stark had been warging into Summer .
Bran Stark,Lord Eddard , in the courtyard watching his son , Bran Stark at archery training , decrees that as a deserter from the Watch , Will is an oathbreaker and must die .
Bran Stark,Meanwhile , Bran Stark and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the Seven Kingdoms proper , and entered into the Gift : a stretch of land south of the Wall which was gifted to the Night 's Watch thousands of years ago by Brandon the Builder , from which the Watch draws support for its material needs .
Bran Stark,Nearby , Bran Stark and his companions hear the child 's cries ; warging into Summer , Bran goes to investigate , but Summer falls into a trap just outside Craster 's Keep .
Bran Stark,Ramsay seemingly falls for it , saying that it took much longer for him to get Theon Greyjoy over to his side but that Theon told him everything , including how Osha had seduced Theon in order to help Rickon and Bran Stark escape Winterfell .
Bran Stark,Theon tells Bran Stark to surrender the castle to him to save his people .
Brandon,As Sansa wanders around the castle , coming to the tower where Jaime Lannister pushed her brother Brandon out of the window , she runs into Myranda .
Brandon,She also rants about Catelyn 's love for Sansa 's uncle Brandon and how he nearly killed Petyr .
Brandon,When Eddard tells her he is to faithfully serve their King , Cersei remarks that as his brother Brandon was born to lead , Eddard was born to follow .
Brandon the Builder,Meanwhile , Bran Stark and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the Seven Kingdoms proper , and entered into the Gift : a stretch of land south of the Wall which was gifted to the Night 's Watch thousands of years ago by Brandon the Builder , from which the Watch draws support for its material needs .
Bread,Wolf Bread
Brienne,Accompanied by Brienne , Sansa furiously confronts Petyr Baelish , asking if he was aware what Ramsay Bolton was capable of .
Brienne,After a moment 's hesitation , Brienne swings her sword at him .
Brienne,As Brienne and Podrick prepare to leave the inn , Podrick reminds Brienne that telling people of their quest could be dangerous , but Brienne 's honesty is swiftly rewarded when Hot Pie approaches and gives them a loaf of bread shaped like a wolf .
Brienne,As Brienne and Podrick search the surrounding area for Arya in vain , Arya makes her way down the cliff side to find the Hound badly wounded .
Brienne,As Sansa prays alone in the godswood , she is watched by Jaime and Brienne ; Brienne expects Jaime to uphold his oath to return Catelyn Stark 's daughters in return for his freedom , but Jaime counters by pointing out the situation is complicated by Catelyn 's death and Sansa 's marriage to Tyrion .
Brienne,As preparations for the royal wedding continue , Margaery Tyrell and her grandmother Olenna are interrupted by Brienne of Tarth , ( Olenna being delighted to see the truth of the rumors about Brienne ) who requests a private word with Margaery .
Brienne,At Castle Black , a war council is called , and is attended by Sansa , Brienne , Podrick , Jon , Davos , Melisandre , Tormund and Eddison Tollett , who discuss the need for more men to defend Castle Black , since the Karstarks and Umbers , two major Houses in the North , have declared for Ramsay .
Brienne,At Harrenhal , Jaime speaks one last time to Brienne before he leaves .
Brienne,Before departing , Brienne names the sword `` Oathkeeper '' and vows to find Sansa , for the sake of Jaime and Lady Catelyn .
Brienne,Brienne implores Arya to come with her to safety , causing the Hound to mock Brienne , pointing out that there is no `` safety '' for Arya anymore : her aunt Lysa Arryn in the Eyrie - whom Brienne and Podrick are seeking out - is dead , as are her father , mother , and older brother , while the Stark armies are scattered and Winterfell is a smoking ruin .
Brienne,Catelyn is impressed with Brienne .
Brienne,Correctly suspecting that he is still loyal to the Starks , Brienne tells of her allegiance to Catelyn Stark and convinces the servant to get a message through to Sansa - her presence still being something of a secret , the old servant seems to gain strength from the idea of a surviving Stark .
Brienne,Exhausted , Jaime says he 's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce ; Brienne says you need trust to have a truce , but he says he trusts her , so she sits back down .
Brienne,He continues to casually mock Renly which makes Brienne grab him , but he relents and says he does n't particularly care that Renly loved Loras , as he feels people are n't free to choose the ones they love ( which he knows better than most ) .
Brienne,He tells Sansa that Brienne and Pod will do a better job of looking after her , though he tearfully states that he would have gone with her all the way to Castle Black if necessary .
Brienne,He then asks of Brienne 's business , to which she replies that she is in Lady Stark 's service to find and protect Sansa Stark .
Brienne,His kingsguard Brienne is mistakenly blamed for the death and she flees the camp with Catelyn Stark .
Brienne,In desperation , Jaime leaps into the pit to help her ; before the bear can harm either of them , Steelshanks shoots it with a crossbow , distracting the beast long enough for Jaime and Brienne to be pulled out of the pit .
Brienne,In the chambers of the Kingsguard , Jaime tasks Brienne with finding Sansa .
Brienne,In the woods , Brienne fills Sansa in on her encounter with Arya , whilst Sansa is reluctant to talk about her experiences under Ramsay Bolton 's tyranny at Winterfell .
Brienne,Jaime Lannister provokes Brienne into a duel but finds himself recaptured .
Brienne,Jaime assumes that Brienne will accompany him , but Bolton intends to keep her with him , under arrest for abetting treason .
Brienne,Jaime begins to tire , and Brienne wears him down further by making body-blows with kicks and punches .
Brienne,Jaime continues to mock Brienne along the way .
Brienne,Jaime deduces that Brienne is n't from the North because he would have noticed her at Winterfell when he visited there , so ( as she is from House Tarth ) she must be a Baratheon supporter .
Brienne,Jaime gravely says that was `` unworthy '' and asks for forgiveness , Brienne angrily orders him not to mock her , but he insists he 's seriously apologizing .
Brienne,Jaime is disgusted by this pointless brutality , so he points out to Locke that Brienne is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of Lord Selwyn of Tarth , the `` Sapphire Isle , '' and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires - provided that she is unharmed .
Brienne,Jaime is recognized and Brienne chose to kill the soldiers .
Brienne,Jaime makes it plain to Brienne that was his breaking point and asks her what she would do if her precious Renly commanded her to kill her own father and then stand by and do nothing as he murdered thousands of innocent people ; she can only sit in shocked silence .
Brienne,Jaime orders Locke to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants , but Locke dismisses the offer , getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of Brienne being torn apart .
Brienne,Jaime quips that it 's no wonder Renly died with Brienne guarding him , at which she defiantly stands up out of the bath , facing him fully nude , to show him she is n't afraid of him .
Brienne,Jaime remarks that he owes Brienne a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his hand .
Brienne,Jaime starts off very aggressively , putting Brienne on the defensive .
Brienne,Jaime tasks Brienne with his honor .
Brienne,Jaime tells Brienne that he suspects the man is a scout meant to intercept them , and even if he is n't he can still spread word he saw them .
Brienne,Jaime then asks about Brienne ; Qyburn confirms that they sent a raven to her father , Lord Selwyn Tarth , and he offered a ransom of 300 Gold Dragons for his daughter 's safe return .
Brienne,Jaime then departs Harrenhal with his escort and Brienne in tow .
Brienne,Jaime then notes that Brienne has the same look on her face that he 's seen on countless faces in the past seventeen years : people that despise him , call him `` kingslayer '' more than his own name , or `` oathbreaker '' and `` a man without honor . ''
Brienne,Jaime then walks naked into the same communal bath that Brienne is in , on the far side .
Brienne,Later that night Jaime and Brienne are restrained near a campfire .
Brienne,Later that night Locke 's men make camp , and do indeed drag Brienne kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang-rape her .
Brienne,Littlefinger and Sansa 's carriage passes them , Brienne unaware of how close her goal is .
Brienne,Locke , who has been left in charge of the castle in Bolton 's absence , ca n't resist poking fun at the departing Jaime and sneers that he will 'take good care ' of Brienne , though Jaime does n't rise to the bait .
Brienne,Locke agrees and calls his men back before they are able to rape Brienne , and they tie her up to a tree again .
Brienne,Meanwhile , Brienne and Podrick stop at an inn where they are served kidney pie made by none other than Hot Pie , who proceeds to tell them at length the process in finding the right ingredients .
Brienne,Meanwhile , Brienne stares intently at Winterfell castle from her room in the inn , waiting for the sign to rescue Sansa .
Brienne,Pod and Brienne run into trouble on the road .
Brienne,Podrick Payne attempts to plan the next move for himself and Brienne of Tarth , but Brienne tells him that she does n't want anyone following her .
Brienne,Podrick spots Sansa Stark with Petyr Baelish , and Brienne tells him to ready the horses and she confronts them .
Brienne,Podrick thinks that Sansa may be better off at Winterfell now that she is far away from the Lannisters , but Brienne believes that Sansa will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother - the Boltons .
Brienne,Renly , along with his Kingsguard members Brienne and Ser Loras Tyrell , counters that no one wants Stannis to be king .
Brienne,Reuniting , Podrick mentions how both Stark girls denied her request for protection , but Brienne retorts by doubting Sansa is safe with Littlefinger .
Brienne,Sansa accepts Brienne into her service .
Brienne,Sansa denies Brienne 's request and Littlefinger urges that she stay at the inn as the road is not safe , and seeing this as a trap , Brienne escapes with Podrick on the horses they take .
Brienne,Sansa subsequently tasks Brienne and Podrick with securing Brynden 's help while the rest of them leave Castle Black to start building their army .
Brienne,She doubts Baelish 's ability to protect her or even himself , threatening to have Brienne kill him .
Brienne,Some time later , Brienne is in Harrenhal 's bathhouse , scrubbing off weeks ' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the Riverlands .
Brienne,Stannis , having lost everything , simply accepts his fate to die : he tells Brienne to do her `` duty '' .
Brienne,Still bitter over the death of King Renly Baratheon , Brienne warns Melisandre that she does not forget or forgive .
Brienne,Stunned , Brienne asks why Jaime did n't defend himself with this account before .
Brienne,The Hound immediately accuses Brienne of working for the Lannisters , noticing her Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper , which Brienne admits was given to her by Jaime , frightening Arya into thinking that Brienne is working for the Lannisters .
Brienne,The captain corrects him , stating that they are sailing through the Sapphire Isle , which reminds him of Brienne .
Brienne,Their conversation is interrupted by Brienne , who recognizes Davos and Melisandre as Stannis ' former entourage .
Brienne,Therefore , Brienne and Podrick decide to head for the Eyrie .
Brienne,They are bound for Castle Black , where Brienne believes Sansa may have taken refuge with her half-brother , Jon Snow .
Brienne,They are chased through a forest as Brienne fights the men and Podrick is thrown off his horse .
Brienne,They are interrupted by the return of the Hound , who is immediately recognized by Podrick , causing Brienne to realize that the girl is Arya .
Brienne,They were only sent to capture Jaime , therefore Brienne means nothing to them , so at the slightest provocation they will kill her without hesitation .
Brienne,This brings Catelyn to breaking point and she asks for Brienne 's sword .
Brienne,Tied up back to back on one of the horses , Jaime warns Brienne that when they make camp for the night , they will rape her , more than once , and that his honest advice is to give no resistance , and just think of Renly .
Brienne,Ultimately , Brienne gains the upper hand ( by biting off a chunk of Sandor 's ear ) and knocks him down a cliff side .
Brienne,Upon arriving at Harrenhal , Jaime is shocked and furious to find Locke and his cronies have thrown Brienne into a bear pit , facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself , as they all mockingly sing The Bear and the Maiden Fair .
Brienne,When Jaime reminds her that she killed Stark men , Brienne responds that she does not serve House Stark , but Catelyn Stark .
Brienne,When Qyburn mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing Brienne before they die in battle or winter , Jaime , feeling guilty because his lie to protect Brienne has invertantly placed her in greater danger , urges Steelshanks to return to Harrenhal .
Brienne,While Brienne is a noblewoman and worth a ransom , Tarth is called `` the Sapphire Isle '' due to the color of the seas around it , not because there are any actual sapphires , and House Tarth is not particularly rich .
Brienne,While on the road , Podrick proves to be a hindrance to Brienne .
Brienne of Tarth,As preparations for the royal wedding continue , Margaery Tyrell and her grandmother Olenna are interrupted by Brienne of Tarth , ( Olenna being delighted to see the truth of the rumors about Brienne ) who requests a private word with Margaery .
Brienne of Tarth,At Harrenhal , Locke presents the captive Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to the Northern castellan , Lord Roose Bolton .
Brienne of Tarth,At Harrenhal , Lord Roose Bolton has dinner with Jaime and Brienne of Tarth .
Brienne of Tarth,Catelyn has sent Brienne of Tarth to escort Jaime to King 's Landing to exchange him for her daughters , Sansa and Arya .
Brienne of Tarth,Finally , Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are slowly making their way across country through the Riverlands , heading to King 's Landing intending to make the prisoner exchange for the Stark girls ( really , just Sansa ) .
Brienne of Tarth,In the Vale , Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne are heading towards the Bloody Gate when they happen upon Arya Stark practicing her water dancing while Sandor Clegane is off relieving himself , both returning from the Eyrie after receiving words of Lysa Arryn 's death .
Brienne of Tarth,Podrick Payne attempts to plan the next move for himself and Brienne of Tarth , but Brienne tells him that she does n't want anyone following her .
Brienne of Tarth,Robb introduces Talisa to his mother Catelyn Stark , who has returned from the Stormlands along with Brienne of Tarth .
Brienne of Tarth,Sansa Stark , Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne ride through the gates and dismount in the courtyard .
Brienne of Tarth,She watches Brienne of Tarth defeat Ser Loras Tyrell and claim a place in Renly 's kingsguard .
Brienne of Tarth,Somewhere else in the Riverlands , Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth have been taken captive by Locke and a detachment of men from House Bolton .
Brienne of Tarth,The following day , Locke 's men lead their prisoners Jaime and Brienne of Tarth back to Harrenhal on horseback .
Brienne of Tarth,Traveling east to King 's Landing , Brienne of Tarth and Jaime Lannister come upon the bodies of three women , hanged by Stark soldiers for having slept with Lannister soldiers .
Brienne of Tarth,Unknown to everyone in King 's Landing , Jaime Lannister , Brienne of Tarth , and Qyburn finally arrive ; the city folk do not even recognize Jaime after his long absence from the capital .
Broken Tower,Consoling Sansa that she still has allies in the North , she tells Sansa to light a candle in the highest window of the Broken Tower if she ever needs help .
Broken Tower,Ramsay then brings up the reason why he summoned her , and shows her the crucified and partly flayed corpse of the old woman who promised to help Sansa if she lit a candle in the Broken Tower .
Broken Tower,Sansa informs him that her family still has allies in the North and tells him to light a candle at the top of the Broken Tower which will signal them that she is in danger .
Bronn,After he finishes , the two parties trade barbs , and Tyene inquires about Bronn 's arm , which she cut with her daggers during their earlier fight , with Bronn brushing it off as `` a new scar '' .
Bronn,Annoyed , Bronn then drags off the bodies to bury .
Bronn,Areo leads Bronn back to the solar where Doran , Jaime , and the rest remain .
Bronn,As she gets romantic with Tyrion , Bronn leaves the tent .
Bronn,As they commence training , Bronn uses his usual dirty tactics and gets the better of Jaime , teaching him not only to use his offhand , but encouraging him to fight dirtier .
Bronn,Below decks , Bronn remarks on why Jaime must want to go and protect Princess Myrcella for himself : he 's the one who let Tyrion escape , and he hopes this will make up for that .
Bronn,Bronn collapses and tries to play off his sudden illness , but Tyene reveals that her daggers were coated with a slow-acting poison called The Long Farewell , and her attempts to seduce Bronn were to get his heart pumping faster , thereby allowing the poison to act quicker .
Bronn,Bronn fights defensively , waiting for Vardis to tire , as unlike Bronn he is dressed in full armor .
Bronn,Bronn has been awaiting Tyrion 's signal outside the city on the shores of the bay , and when Tyrion tosses a torch from the battlements , Bronn fires a flaming arrow triggering a massive , massive aquatic explosion .
Bronn,Bronn is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until Jaime tells him that if he helps rescue Myrcella from Dorne , Bronn will receive a much better girl than Lollys , who has rights to a much better castle .
Bronn,Bronn is worried that the ship 's captain will subsequently spread word that a Lannister is in Dorne ; Jaime says he bribed him with a large bag of gold , but Bronn still worries .
Bronn,Bronn wonders what Jaime will do once they get inside and find Myrcella , to which Jaime replies that he likes to improvise ; Bronn sarcastically remarks `` That explains the golden hand . ''
Bronn,During their sword training , Bronn implores Jaime to visit his brother Tyrion in the dungeon , saying that Tyrion named Jaime his champion in The Eyrie because he knew Jaime would ride day and night to fight for him .
Bronn,Further north in the Crownlands at Castle Stokeworth , Bronn is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed Lollys Stokeworth .
Bronn,Growing weaker , Bronn barely manages to reply affirmatively , and she tosses the ampoule to a relieved Bronn .
Bronn,He can not speak to Bronn either because , as a close associate of Tyrion , he is also under investigation .
Bronn,He guesses correctly that Bronn has been beyond the Wall and killed someone before he was twelve years old ( though it was a woman , not a man , and he killed her in self-defense , because she was coming at him with an axe ) .
Bronn,He refuses to fight the Mountain ( whom Cersei has chosen for her champion ) , both for lack of a reward and believing Clegane is too dangerous for him to face , and bids farewell to Tyrion , who while heartbroken by Bronn 's decision , understands .
Bronn,He storms back to his tent to find that Bronn has found him , as per instruction , a whore named Shae .
Bronn,He takes advice from Bronn and Varys and infers that he has decided to make use of the stocks of wildfire .
Bronn,Impressed that the women would provide their services for free , Tyrion and Bronn ask Pod to explain in detail what transpired , so they can take `` copious notes . ''
Bronn,In the Eyrie , Tyrion Lannister wagers everything on the greed of the sellsword Bronn .
Bronn,Jaime , Bronn , Ellaria and the Sand Snakes are all taken into custody .
Bronn,Jaime , Bronn , Myrcella and Trystane say their farewells to the Martells to return to King 's Landing .
Bronn,Jaime and Bronn draw their swords and fight the rest .
Bronn,Jaime and Bronn present themselves and try to pass off that they are simple travelers and their boat capsized in the night , but the ruse does n't work , and the sentries demand that they drop their weapons so they can be taken prisoner and their identities confirmed .
Bronn,Jaime and Bronn reach their destination .
Bronn,Jaime ca n't fight very well left-handed so Bronn kills one sentry 's horse in order for Jaime to fight him on foot .
Bronn,Jaime politely insists that Bronn was only following orders and they ca n't punish him for simply following Jaime 's commands .
Bronn,Jaime then asks what fate will befall Bronn , who is still imprisoned .
Bronn,Jaime then gladly informs Bronn that the Martells agreed to let Bronn go with Jaime , but on one condition : wordlessly , Areo then delivers it by striking Bronn in the face with his elbow , the large guard captain hitting him so hard that he is knocked to the floor .
Bronn,Jaime tries to convince Myrcella to come with him , but Trystane interferes , suspicious of the bloodstains on Bronn and Jaime 's Dornish robes .
Bronn,Lysa complains that Bronn did not fight with honor .
Bronn,Meanwhile , Bronn gives a lesson to an unlikely pupil ; Bran 's vision helps map out his journey ; Stannis loses patience with Davos ; and Ramsay takes a perverse delight in his new pet .
Bronn,Myrcella and her intended Trystane Martell Jaime and Bronn infiltrate the Water Gardens and soon come upon Myrcella kissing Trystane .
Bronn,Obara orders Nym to break away from Bronn and take Myrcella prisoner , but as Nym tries to pull her away , they are cut off by Areo and Prince Doran 's guards , who surround them and force them all to drop their weapons .
Bronn,Quickly Tyrion gains the favor of a sellsword , Bronn , who agrees to give his room to Tyrion .
Bronn,She points to an ampoule on her necklace , which contains the antidote , but only offers to give it to Bronn on the condition that he agrees that she is the most beautiful woman in the world .
Bronn,The Faith Militant grow increasingly aggressive ; Jaime and Bronn head south ; Ellaria and the Sand Snakes vow vengeance .
Bronn,The Pentoshi ship captain found her in Planky Town , and as Bronn feared , he indeed tried to sell her information about Jaime Lannister 's arrival in Dorne .
Bronn,The guards arrive and release Bronn , and Tyene mocks him as he leaves .
Bronn,The two begin to talk about Tyene 's beauty , which Bronn dismisses until she begins to disrobe .
Bronn,They eagerly agree , and escort Tyrion and Bronn westwards towards where the Lannister armies are gathering .
Bronn,They seem to get on relatively well , but when Lollys reminds Bronn that her older sister will get the castle when their mother dies , he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what 's coming to them , clearly setting his sights on the castle .
Bronn,Tyene once again inquires about his arm , and then his head , at which point Bronn 's nose starts bleeding and his vision blurs .
Bronn,Tyrion , Bronn , Shagga and the rest of the hill tribesmen arrive at the Lannister encampment , to find Lord Tywin Lannister and his brother , Ser Kevan , planning to engage the Stark army , which is moving south from the Neck .
Bronn,Tyrion , Bronn , and Shae play a drinking game the night before the battle .
Bronn,Tyrion Lannister , Bronn , and Podrick Payne wait on a road outside the city for the arrival of Prince Doran Martell of Dorne , who has been invited to the royal wedding .
Bronn,Tyrion Lannister has his blindfold removed and finds that their party - augmented by several knights and the sellsword Bronn from the Crossroads Inn - is on the Eastern Road en route to the Vale of Arryn .
Bronn,Tyrion and Bronn
Bronn,Tyrion and Bronn enter , and Oberyn and Tyrion step outside to speak privately .
Bronn,Tyrion and Bronn have reached the western edge of the Vale and are surrounded by members of the hill tribes , led by a fearsome warrior named Shagga .
Bronn,Tyrion and Bronn then lead Pod into another room of the brothel , where Tyrion says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the Battle of the Blackwater : he has paid for Podrick ( who has never had sex with a woman ) to enjoy the services of not one , but three prostitutes : Marei , Genna , and a contortionist named Kayla ( one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a `` Meereenese Knot '' ) .
Bronn,Tyrion congratulates her on her cunning , while pointing out that his father will give out a handsome reward for his safe return ( a point that clearly piques Bronn 's interest ) .
Bronn,Tyrion desperately asks for volunteers , and after a long pause during which it seems that Tyrion 's cause is lost , the sellsword Bronn steps forward and says he will stand for him .
Bronn,Tyrion fumes at the situation to his sellsword Bronn , who has recently been knighted as a reward for his service in the Battle of the Blackwater .
Bronn,Tyrion has Janos arrested and exiled to the Night 's Watch and installs Bronn as Commander of the City Watch in his place .
Bronn,Tyrion quizzes Bronn on the sigils of the Dornish houses , none of which he knows , however Podrick answers perfectly .
Bronn,Tyrion then requests Jaime to bring him Bronn , hoping the sellsword will stand for him just as he did at the Eyrie .
Bronn,Tyrion warns Bronn that when debtors to the Iron Bank can not repay their loans , the Iron Bank will first refuse to give out new loans , and ultimately support rebellions against them .
Bronn,Upon saying goodbye , Ellaria Sand kisses Myrcella on the lips , while Tyene Sand flirts with Bronn .
Bronn,Varys visits and tells him that Bronn has been relieved of his command of the gold cloaks and his hill tribesmen have gone home with their plunder ; Tyrion has lost all of his power .
Bronn,When Bronn enters and tries to escort her out , she slaps him and runs away .
Bronn,When Ser Meryn tries to support the king , Tyrion silences the Kingsguard by ordering Bronn to kill Meryn if the knight opens his mouth again .
Bronn,When Shae starts to question Tyrion , Bronn reveals that he heard Tyrion was once married .
Bronn,When Trystane tries to draw his sword , Bronn quickly knocks him down , to Myrcella 's horror .
Bronn,When Tyrion asks if he saw it sail away , Bronn assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her , that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and Varys .
Bronn,When Tyrion later asks Bronn if she is gone , he says that she boarded the ship .
Bronn,When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon , Bronn tells him that the Lannisters won the battle , but it was a feint .
Bronn,When they awake the next morning Bronn kills a snake that was near Jaime 's head and roasts it up for breakfast .
Bronn,When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning , Bronn goes off to find one for himself .

Brotherhood,At the camp of the Brotherhood Without Banners , Arya , disillusioned with the Brotherhood for selling Gendry , takes an opportunity to escape and runs off into the night .

Brotherhood,The Brotherhood , closing in on something Sandor actually did , charge him with the crime of following orders to kill Mycah , but that they will give him a fair trial : Dondarrion himself will face Sandor in a trial by combat .
Brotherhood,The Brotherhood continues to cite various Lannister crimes : Thoros says he was there during the Sack of King 's Landing and saw the butchered corpses of the royal children , Rhaenys and Aegon Targaryen .
Brotherhood,The Brotherhood had taken all of the gold Sandor had on him ( to fund their cause ) , and in lieu of returning it , Beric gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war .
Brotherhood,The Brotherhood points out that the Lannister `` lions '' have been butchering the innocent .
Brotherhood,The Hound balks that Eddard and Robert are dead now , and he ca n't just be fighting for ghosts , but Dondarrion says that now the Brotherhood are ghosts , attacking the Lannisters where they least expect them , melting away back to their hideouts in the woods .
Brotherhood,The Hound is brought before the Brotherhood to answer for his crimes .

Brusco,The bouncer Brusco does n't want her in at first but the prostitute Lhara , who is one of Arya 's regular customers , tells him to let her stay , as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac .
Brynden,Brynden explains that he did : on his deathbed Hoster told him to stop calling himself `` the Blackfish '' as it was a stupid joke created over thirty years ago by Brynden to symbolize his bad relationship with his older brother , and it was n't very funny to begin with .
Brynden,In Catelyn 's old chamber in the castle , she mourns with her uncle Brynden over her father 's death .
Brynden,Jon points out that they can summon the rest of the minor Houses , such as the Mormonts , Glovers , Cerwyns , and Mazins , to rival their enemies , and Sansa reveals Brynden 's successful retaking of Riverrun , though she claims she learned via one of Ramsay 's ravens in order to stop Jon from pursuing Littlefinger .

Brynden,Robb and Brynden , however , are furious with Edmure : their grand strategy was to lure Tywin and Gregor's armies into the Westerlands , where they would be vulnerable , out of position , and unable to defend the capital against the Baratheons .
Brynden,Sansa subsequently tasks Brienne and Podrick with securing Brynden 's help while the rest of them leave Castle Black to start building their army .
Brynden Tully,Bolton expresses his concern that Brynden Tully escaped the massacre , but Walder dismisses his worries , pointing out that the Blackfish - and the remaining Tully garrison at Riverrun - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the Lannisters , Boltons , and Freys , although Bolton is still visibly concerned .
Brynden Tully,He obeys , but not before informing that her great-uncle Brynden Tully has recaptured Riverrun and recommending she seek him out and the remaining loyal Tully forces .

Casterly Rock,Joffrey goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather , deriding Tywin as a coward who hid under Casterly Rock while Joffrey 's father King Robert won the real war when he overthrew the Targaryens .
Casterly Rock,Margaery mocks Cersei for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her , going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme , she does n't understand innocence and decency , which Margaery suspects is why Tommen loves her , Margaery , and was willing to send Cersei back to Casterly Rock .
Casterly Rock,Reluctantly , Tyrion explains that when he was very young , he and Jaime were out riding near Casterly Rock and found a young common girl in distress from bandits .

Casterly Rock,Theon implores his father to reconsider , claiming that if the Greyjoys attack the North , they face the possibility of total destruction if they lose , but if they ally with the Starks and win , Balon will be crowned King of the Iron Islands and House Greyjoy will be awarded Casterly Rock and essentially the source of the Lannisters ' wealth along with it , but Balon rebuffs Theon and chastises him for becoming loyal to the Starks .

Castle Black,Alliser gives an impassioned speech , promising that the ancient order of the Night 's Watch and Castle Black will survive this battle .
Castle Black,Apart from Castle Black ( which even the wildlings know is manned ) , there is also Eastwatch-by-the-Sea at the extreme eastern end , and The Shadow Tower at the western end .
Castle Black,As Jon prepares to leave via Castle Black 's tunnel , they discover the bodies of the black brothers who held the inner gate against the giant .

Castle Black,Davos notes that their situation is now dire : they do n't have enough food to make the march back to Castle Black or to advance to Winterfell , and without their siege weapons they have little chance of storming the castle to take its food supplies anyway .
Castle Black,Davos thinks that they should go back to Castle Black and wait out the weather since they do not have enough food , but Stannis stubbornly tells him that they will not retreat to Castle Black because he will not risk being known as `` the King who Ran '' .
Castle Black,Down in Castle Black , the battle rages on between the wildlings and the Night 's Watch .

Castle Black,Jon is then asked how many men currently garrison Castle Black .
Castle Black,Jon is very reluctant to answer , but after being threatened by Orell , he gives an exaggerated number , saying there are one thousand men ( this is a lie , as Castle Black only had six hundred men before the Great Ranging , and the garrison now is closer to three hundred ) .
Castle Black,Jon leaves Castle Black , but is pursued .
Castle Black,Jon notes they have a bigger problem ; if Mole 's Town has been destroyed , Castle Black is next , and the few black brothers who remain are outnumbered a thousand to one by Mance Rayder 's army .

Castle Black,Mance guesses there are no more than 50 men left guarding Castle Black , but Jon lies and insists that there are still over 1,000 men defending the garrison .
Castle Black,Mance orders Tormund to take Jon with him , as Jon knows the layout of Castle Black , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty : if it turns out that he wo n't really betray the Night 's Watch , Tormund can easily throw him off the Wall to his death .
Castle Black,Mance orders Tormund to take a force of twenty men to scale The Wall to attack Castle Black from its exposed rear .
Castle Black,Meanwhile , Alliser Thorne is locked in a vicious duel with Tormund on the catwalks of Castle Black , both seemingly evenly matched in skill .

Castle Black,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Castle Black,Sam is forced to leave Pyp 's body and as he heads to Castle Black 's lift system , but he is spotted by the Thenn warg .
Castle Black,Sam shows Gilly the Dragonglass dagger he found at the Fist of the First Men and tells her about Castle Black .
Castle Black,Sam tells Gilly that they are a considerable distance west of Castle Black , but this is n't a problem , because this means they are close to the Nightfort , the original headquarters of the Night 's Watch , which was abandoned centuries ago as the organization 's numbers dwindled .
Castle Black,Samwell Tarly and Gilly continue on their journey to Castle Black , taking refuge in a destroyed cabin next to a heart tree .

Castle Black,Some time later , Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton stating that he has Rickon Stark at Winterfell and if Sansa is not returned , he will slaughter every Wildling at Castle Black , let his men rape Sansa , and feed Jon and Rickon to his dogs .
Castle Black,South of the Wall , the Thenn warg 's owl also spots the fire and informs Styr and Tormund that the time has come to attack Castle Black .
Castle Black,Stannis begins to apologise for dragging her along on campaign with him , as Castle Black is hardly a place for a child , but Shireen cuts him off ; she is happy to have come , having expected to be left at Dragonstone , as Selyse had made it clear she wanted .
Castle Black,The Night 's Watch , although hopelessly outnumbered , attempts to defend Castle Black from Mance Rayder 's massive wildling army , who plan to siege the fortress from the north .
Castle Black,The band of wildlings manage to reach Castle Black 's walls and begin scaling them using grappling hooks and ropes , forcing Sam and Pyp to retreat .
Castle Black,The following morning , what is left of Castle Black 's garrison begin to regroup and prepare for the inevitable next attack by Mance Rayder .
Castle Black,The group immediately take off towards Castle Black 's southern gate , while Ygritte seems to have second thoughts .
Castle Black,The groups then head in different directions ; Sam and Gilly for Castle Black , and the Reeds , Hodor , and Bran beyond the Wall .
Castle Black,The owl is revealed to be controlled by a Thenn warg who is a member of the garrison of wildlings under command of Tormund and Styr , who have set up camp just outside of the southern entrance to Castle Black .

Cersei,After he leaves , Pycelle bitterly points out that the Small Council is growing even smaller ( the only three members left in the capital are Pycelle , Cersei , and her lackey Qyburn ) , but she says it has n't quite grown small enough yet .
Cersei,Against Cersei 's ineffectual protests , Joffrey gets up and , flanked by his Kingsguard , taunts Sansa that she 's still found a way to marry a Lannister .
Cersei,Although unsympathetic , Cersei decides to meet with the High Sparrow , who turns out to be a humble man serving food to the poor , barefoot .
Cersei,Armed with this new information , Cersei barges into a Small Council meeting between Kevan Lannister , Olenna Tyrell , and Jaime Lannister .
Cersei,Arya sneaks into the dressing room after the play to observe her target - the actress playing Cersei - who appears to be a clever , decent woman .
Cersei,As Lancel leaves , he also casually agrees that he will accede to Cersei 's request and free Pycelle if she wants him as a `` pet '' , though he does n't want him back on the Small Council .
Cersei,As Margaery is forcefully dragged away , she calls out for Tommen , paralyzed with indecision , while Olenna sadly regards Cersei 's barely contained smug expression .
Cersei,As Tyrion works in his chamber late at night , his cousin Lancel Lannister knocks on his door delivering orders from Cersei to release Grand Maester Pycelle from the dungeon at once .
Cersei,As Tywin and Tommen leave , Jaime enters to see Cersei calling for the death of the accused Tyrion and his wife , Sansa Stark .
Cersei,As the conversation goes on , however , it 's clear that the High Sparrow is about to turn the tables on Cersei .
Cersei,As they finish , Loras mentions that he is engaged to be married ... a fact that Olyvar passes on to his real master , Littlefinger , so he can pass the information on to Cersei .
Cersei,At Tywin 's wake , Cersei is approached by Lancel Lannister .
Cersei,Baelish points out that Tywin is dead , Jaime is one-handed and politically useless , and that Cersei is about to be forced into the background by Margaery , who is quite fond of Sansa .
Cersei,Baelish proposes that the soldiers of the Vale could fight instead but Cersei is unsure of Baelish 's ability to lead an army .
Cersei,Baelish says he hopes Tyrion does well in the position , as he owes him for securing the release of Ros ( after Cersei arrested her , mistaking her for Shae ) but Tyrion says it was just a misunderstanding .
Cersei,Bolton toys with Jaime but remains completely calm , never even grinning , before finally revealing that his sister Cersei is alive and well , and his father 's forces successfully repulsed Stannis 's assault .
Cersei,Bronn visits Tyrion in the clothes of a lord , having been betrothed to Lollys Stokeworth , by Cersei 's doing .
Cersei,Cersei and Tyrion Lannister observe the couple from Cersei 's chambers overlooking the garden .
Cersei,Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it , comparing their love to the old Targaryen practice of marrying brother to sister ; she also admits to having despised Robert ever since their wedding night , when Robert drunkenly stumbled into Cersei 's bed and called her `` Lyanna '' .
Cersei,Cersei flatly refuses , but Tywin is insistent : the marriages of Cersei and Tyrion will place the North and the Reach firmly in the Lannisters ' control .
Cersei,Cersei only knows how to rule through fear , but Margaery knows how to win the love of the people she rules over , a skill Cersei lacks .
Cersei,Consulting the book 's entry on House Baratheon , Lord Eddard finds that every time a Baratheon has married , the children have had black hair ... right up to Cersei and Robert 's children , who are all blond .
Cersei,Convincing Jaime that he did n't kill Joffrey , Tyrion notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy Cersei .
Cersei,Deducing that this is Margaery 's doing , Cersei pays her a visit , to find Margaery busy gloating about her `` exhausting '' night with the King .
Cersei,Despite their differences , the High Sparrow claims admiration for the deep love that Cersei has for her son , Tommen , which he attributes to the divine love of the Mother .
Cersei,During a childhood visit to Casterly Rock , Cersei showed Tyrion , with great ceremony , to Oberyn and Elia .
Cersei,Eddard says he wanted to extend mercy to Cersei 's children , whom Robert would have killed if he 'd known the truth .
Cersei,Ellaria notes how odd it is that she and Oberyn were looked down on for their sexuality in King 's Landing , and Jaime is scorned for his incestuous love for Cersei - to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement - though a hundred years ago , if his name were Targaryen , no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship .
Cersei,Finally , she tells Cersei that her reign will not last : she will be queen , but eventually a younger and more beautiful queen is fated to take her place , along with everything she holds dear .
Cersei,Finally giving in , Cersei is brought before the High Sparrow to confess her sins .

Cersei,Gregor asks who he will be fighting , Cersei asks if it matters , and he shakes his head .
Cersei,He admits to Tyrion that the `` Queen '' he is taking him to is not Cersei but Daenerys .
Cersei,He agrees , but Cersei warns him that this had better produce more results than when she previously asked him to find Arya Stark , but the girl could not be found .
Cersei,He also opines that as Tywin is dead , no one will force Cersei to marry him anymore .
Cersei,He also tells them that Bran is expected to live and notes Cersei and Jaime 's guarded reactions .
Cersei,He also warns Pod to be aware of his surroundings and watch out for `` They , '' `` They '' being the spies of Tywin , Cersei , Varys or more or less anyone else .

Cersei,He details the incestuous relationship between Cersei and Jaime Lannister and challenges Joffrey 's legitimacy .
Cersei,He has become a devout member of the Sparrows , a religious cult , and asks Cersei 's forgiveness for their adulterous relationship , as well as getting her husband Robert Baratheon obscenely drunk on the day he died .
Cersei,He is incredulous that Eddard trusted Littlefinger over him , and even more so that he warned Cersei what he was going to do .
Cersei,He is to bring Cersei and Joffrey to heel and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes .
Cersei,He points out how this will leave Cersei in King 's Landing , free to harass Margaery .
Cersei,He refuses to fight the Mountain ( whom Cersei has chosen for her champion ) , both for lack of a reward and believing Clegane is too dangerous for him to face , and bids farewell to Tyrion , who while heartbroken by Bronn 's decision , understands .
Cersei,He suggests that Cersei 's uncle Kevan Lannister muster a force or have Jaime Lannister lead an army to the North .
Cersei,He tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave Cersei : a handsome young man - implied , in this instance , to be Lancel .
Cersei,He tells her that he knows the secret that Jon Arryn died for : that Cersei 's three children are not Robert 's , but the product of incest between her and Jaime .
Cersei,He tells her that he will get her out of King 's Landing and to Winterfell as a recruit of the Night 's Watch , but he warns her not to trust the other recruits , since apparently half would hand her over to Cersei for a pardon , while the other half would do the same , but only after raping her first .
Cersei,He tells her to be silent , or he will honor her again , and Cersei leaves in anger .
Cersei,He uncovers Pycelle as an informant to Cersei when Cersei confronts him about the plan he fed to Pycelle .
Cersei,He urges her to find and keep the girl safe from those who would hand her over to Cersei and provides her with a horse , supplies , and a freshly forged suit of armor .
Cersei,He wants to start a war for Margaery , declaring his love for her to a dumbstruck Cersei .

Cersei,In a tavern , a man drunkenly boasts of having taunted Cersei during her walk of atonement to the great amusement of the other patrons .
Cersei,In particular , Cersei is nervous about how skilled Margaery Tyrell is at manipulating Joffrey .
Cersei,In return , Cersei will let him take the black and join his younger brother Benjen and bastard son Jon Snow on the Wall .
Cersei,In the Sept 's cells , Cersei meets with Margaery and brings her food but Margaery refuses , revealing that she knows her mother-in-law is responsible for having her and Loras imprisoned .

Cersei,Littlefinger explains why he returned to King 's Landing - he dared not refuse Cersei 's summons , and was obliged to give her information .
Cersei,Littlefinger realizes that even though Lord Eddard has Robert 's edict naming him Regent and Protector of the Realm , he does n't have the men he needs to seize control from Cersei .
Cersei,Mace is oblivious that this is also Cersei 's way of removing him from the capital , and takes it as a high honor - as well as that Cersei will send Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard along to `` guard '' him .
Cersei,Mace offers that House Tyrell could front the money for the time being , but Cersei clearly does not want to give the Tyrells more power over the crown .
Cersei,Maggy is hesitant at first , but after Cersei threatens to have her eyes gouged out , the witch relents .
Cersei,Margaery mocks Cersei for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her , going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme , she does n't understand innocence and decency , which Margaery suspects is why Tommen loves her , Margaery , and was willing to send Cersei back to Casterly Rock .

Cersei,The Waif then interrogates Arya about the people on her list : Cersei , Gregor Clegane and Walder Frey .
Cersei,The handmaiden suddenly enters and says she has important information for Cersei .
Cersei,The next morning , Tommen and Cersei are out for a walk .
Cersei,The royal party 's guards are soon overwhelmed , and Joffrey , Cersei and Tyrion barely make it back to the castle unscathed .
Cersei,The streets of the capital city are overflowing with starving refugees from the War of the Five Kings , as Cersei ignored both Tyrion and Janos Slynt 's earlier warnings that something had to be done to care for the starving peasants or there would be mounting discontent with her son 's rule .
Cersei,Their discussion moves to Lyanna Stark , which surprises Robert , as in seventeen years Cersei has never asked about her .
Cersei,They debate whether to align with Stannis or Renly Baratheon , but there is no agreement as Renly has greater forces , but Stannis is elder and next in line of succession ( if Cersei 's children are discounted ) .
Cersei,They discuss about Jaime 's possible return to King 's Landing , with Cersei wondering where he could possibly be .
Cersei,They make their way to the Red Keep , where Jaime immediately calls on Cersei , who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing hand .
Cersei,They trade barbs about Cersei 's age , Cersei 's capability to have more children , and accusations of incest with Jaime , as well as Loras 's well-known homosexuality .
Cersei,They worry that they have no army to march against the Lannisters , but Ellaria tells them that they do n't need one : to start a war , all they need to do is kill Cersei 's daughter Myrcella , currently in Doran 's possession .
Cersei,Though Cersei attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the Kingsroad behind them , Eddard correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit .
Cersei,To Barristan 's shock , Cersei takes the `` paper shield '' and tears it up .
Cersei,Tommen Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell are wed , much to the dismay of Cersei .
Cersei,Tommen believes that Cersei is to blame for Prince Trystane 's death but tells Jaime that he is n't upset with her .
Cersei,Tommen criticizes the High Sparrow for his self-righteous treatment of Cersei after she had atoned for two of her crimes .
Cersei,Tommen has ordered that Cersei be confined to the Red Keep since he is concerned that the Faith Militant will re-arrest her if she steps inside the sept .
Cersei,Tommen is crowned king of the Seven Kingdoms , while Cersei makes what appears to be a peaceful gesture towards Margaery , who remains wary .
Cersei,Tommen tells his mother that he thinks she should return to Casterly Rock if it will make her happy , since she used to talk so fondly of it , but Cersei declines .
Cersei,Tommen visits Cersei in the Red Keep and apologizes for not being more assertive during her imprisonment .
Cersei,Tyrion can not even reply , shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at Oberyn 's skull-crushed corpse , as does Jaime ; the only different reaction is from Cersei , who stares at Oberyn 's slaughtered body , listening to Tyrion 's death sentence while smirking in vindication .
Cersei,Tyrion enquires whether Lancel was made a knight before or after he started sharing Cersei 's bed .
Cersei,Tyrion gently instructs Lancel that he wo n't tell , but from now on , Lancel must report everything Cersei does back to Tyrion .
Cersei,Tyrion heads to the Small Council chamber to report success to his father Tywin , only to find Cersei present as well , much to his annoyance .
Cersei,Tyrion insists on pursuing the exposed plan to marry Myrcella into House Martell of Dorne over Cersei 's protests .
Cersei,Tyrion orders Hallyne to answer to him instead of Cersei .
Cersei,Tyrion protests that Sansa is a child , but Cersei counters she has flowered and is a woman now who can bear children .
Cersei,Tyrion realizes that while Cersei certainly has the authority to command a Kingsguard , she is n't stupid enough to command Ser Mandon Moore to kill him in public .
Cersei,Tyrion sarcastically asks if Cersei forced him to have sex with her too .
Cersei,Tyrion says that leaves House Tyrell who might be willing to switch sides due to Cersei 's recent schemes against them but that still is n't enough .
Cersei,Tyrion scoffs and rhetorically asks if Cersei is going to kill every dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him ... .
Cersei,Tyrion then simply points out how odd it is that Lancel would be coming from Cersei 's bedchambers in the middle of the night .
Cersei,Tyrion then turns his full fury towards Cersei and says that watching her `` vicious bastard '' of a son die gave him more relief than `` a thousand lying whores . ''
Cersei,Tywin 's daughter Cersei arrives to find the seats are all occupied , but not wanting to play that game and be relegated to a lowly position , she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at Tywin 's right hand , opposite Littlefinger .
Cersei,Tywin bluntly responds that it 's good someone has finally been able to manipulate Joffrey , as Cersei herself has clearly proven to be incapable of doing it .
Cersei,Tywin bursts into the throne room and announces their victory , just in time to stop Cersei from killing Tommen .
Cersei,Tywin confirms that he excludes Cersei from his plans , but not because she is a woman : he distrusts her because she is n't nearly as smart as she thinks she is .
Cersei,Tywin is adamant that Cersei , whom he calls the Kingdom 's most beautiful woman , should marry Loras , the Kingdom 's most handsome and desired bachelor , but Olenna blatantly refuses to consent , hinting that Joffrey is the result of incest .
Cersei,Tywin is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin Cersei reveals that all of the rumors about her and Jaime ( and their children ) are true - she will tell everyone and destroy Tywin 's vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and Tommen 's death .
Cersei,Tywin points out that Cersei is still fertile : she needs to marry and `` breed . ''
Cersei,Tywin refuses to budge , so Cersei plays her trump card : she threatens to destroy House Lannister by telling everyone the truth .
Cersei,Tywin seems confused , and at first Cersei scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance .
Cersei,Tywin shakes with barely constrained rage , but in denial he accuses that Cersei is simply lying to anger him .
Cersei,Unafraid , Cersei walks in first .
Cersei,Upon entering the gates , Cersei finds her uncle Kevan Lannister , Grand Maester Pycelle and Qyburn waiting for her .
Cersei,Upon meeting this `` witch , '' Cersei demands to have her future read .
Cersei,Varys again warns him that he must remain hidden and that it is unsafe to be seen publicly : Cersei has promised a lordship to any man who brings her his head .
Cersei,Varys divulges that Shae has been spotted and that his sister , Cersei , has been notified .
Cersei,Varys says he would like to help , but the most he has are whispers that it was Cersei , but only whispers , and he can not confirm who gave the order .
Cersei,Varys then says that there is nothing he can do to protect Shae any longer in fear of Tywin Lannister , the Hand of the King , or Cersei finding out that he has been lying to them .
Cersei,When Brother Lancel appears , Cersei realizes what is about to happen , and her triumphant smile begins to crack .
Cersei,When Cersei dismisses the accident that claimed Robert 's life , Olenna laments her son 's total lack of military prowess .
Cersei,When Cersei protests further , and calls Robert a woman , he hits her .
Cersei,When Cersei protests she is Queen Regent and not a brood mare , Tywin angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told : she will marry Loras and in so doing , put an end to what Tywin calls `` the disgusting rumors '' Stannis has been spreading about her and Jaime .
Cersei,When Eddard tells her he is to faithfully serve their King , Cersei remarks that as his brother Brandon was born to lead , Eddard was born to follow .
Cersei,When Joffrey naively defends Margaery and criticizes his mother , Cersei realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered .
Cersei,When Lancel comes to tell her that Stannis has reached the walls Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey back to the Red Keep , ignoring his protests that it would damage morale .
Cersei,When Lancel tries to be firm with her , Cersei ignores his counsel , pushes him out of the way ( deliberately causing him pain by hitting his injured side ) , and storms out .
Cersei,When Nymeria can not be found , Cersei spitefully requests that Sansa 's direwolf Lady be killed instead , and Robert acquiesces , upsetting Sansa and angering Arya .
Cersei,When Robert returns from his hunt , he will tell him the truth of the matter and Cersei should run as far as she can before that happens , lest Robert 's wrath find her .
Cersei,When Tyrion arrives with a letter from Lord Tywin , appointing him as acting Hand of the King in Tywin 's stead , Cersei becomes livid .
Cersei,While Joffrey has previously been easy for Margaery to manipulate , Cersei was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind ; the fact that Margaery was married to his uncle Renly ( and thus , already had sex with another man ) , whom Cersei described as a `` traitor and known degenerate '' .
Cersei,While Kevan and Olenna are initially hostile , Cersei convinces them to listen to her .
Cersei,With Cersei out of the picture , both Margaery and Tywin will attempt to get their claws into Tommen , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance .
Cersei,With King Joffrey dead , Cersei mourns the death of her elder son with the heir apparent and , still holding Joffrey in her arms , demands that Sansa Stark be found .
Cersei,With backhanded compliments , Cersei makes it clear that this promotion is really intended to give him an opportunity to make mistakes he will be blamed for .
Cersei,With bloody feet , Cersei eventually makes it to the Red Keep and bursts into tears .

Daario,After a suspenseful pause by Jorah , Daario strides into the room and kneels before the Queen .
Daario,After rejecting his suggestion that she marry him instead , Daario advises her that , on the day the fighting pits are reopened , she should gather all the Great , Wise and Good Masters and kill them .
Daario,As Tyrion watches Daario and Jorah depart the city , Varys calmly walks up to Tyrion .
Daario,At Jorah 's insistence , Daario smashes Aggo 's skull with a rock so that no one will think he was killed with a bladed weapon .
Daario,At the mercenary camp , Mero fondles a Yunkish pleasure-slave while discussing the situation with Prendahl and Daario .
Daario,At this moment Jorah suddenly grabs and hurls a spear at the royal box - embedding itself in a Son of the Harpy sneaking up behind Daario .
Daario,Aware of his dislike of politics , Daenerys asks if Barristan wants to attend her in the throne room ; after being assured that Daario has her back , she gives him the day off , cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below .
Daario,Daario explains that he has been using the Second Sons as spies throughout Meereen , since they are far less conspicuous than Unsullied and can indulge in the same vices as their informants ; Daario indicates his men 's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall , seriously injuring the man hiding behind it .
Daario,Daenerys is elated , but asks after Daario , who is still absent .
Daario,Daenerys is surprised by Daario in her private chambers .
Daario,Daenerys tells Jorah that she sent Daario to take the Second Sons to Yunkai to regain control over the city and kill the masters that have resurfaced .
Daario,Dany counters that the Second Sons are currently acting as Meereen 's police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him ; Daario dismisses the Second Sons ' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants is n't interested .
Daario,Dany focuses on Daario 's other proclaimed talent and orders him to remove his clothes .
Daario,Dany is reluctant to do so , as she believes it will give her the reputation of a butcher , to which Daario replies that `` all rulers are either butchers or meat '' .
Daario,Grey Worm , still recovering from his injuries , offers to go with Jorah and Daario , as does Tyrion .
Daario,He removes his helmet , revealing himself as Daario .
Daario,In Meereen , Daenerys and Daario discuss her impending marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq .
Daario,Intrigued , Daenerys rises from her bath and asks if Daario will swear fealty to her .
Daario,It swiftly becomes apparent that Daario and Mero do not agree , but Prendahl cuts off their philosophical discussion to call for action over `` the dragon bitch . ''
Daario,Jorah and Daario bow down to their queen .
Daario,Jorah and Daario evacuate Daenerys from the royal box , while Tyrion rescues Missandei .
Daario,Jorah and Daario move to the front of the crowd and bow last .
Daario,Jorah and Daario undertake a difficult task .
Daario,Later , Daario convinces her to reconsider , as his youth fighting in the pits gave him the fighting skills necessary for him to join the Second Sons , where he met Daenerys .
Daario,She also says to let Daario know that it was Jorah who changed her mind .
Daario,That night Ser Jorah , Daario , and Grey Worm sneak into the city and fight their way through the slave soldiers guarding Yunkai .
Daario,The Sons of the Harpy routed for now , Daario , Jorah , Missandei and Tyrion look on in astonishment as Drogon soars away .
Daario,The following morning , Daario bumps into Ser Jorah .
Daario,The knight is nearly undone , but Daario saves him at the last minute with the stiletto he smuggled in .
Daario,The pair are interrupted by Jorah and Daario , who take the Lhazareen hostage .
Daario,There are far more soldiers than Daario anticipated , much to Jorah 's irritation , but it seems that the three are evenly matched - barely .
Daario,Though Jorah Mormont is skeptical of both the plan and Daario 's loyalty , Daenerys is convinced to try it when she asks Grey Worm if he trusts Daario .
Daario,Tyrion addresses both Jorah and Daario 's feelings for her , understanding all too well how one could love the wrong woman .
Daario,Upon hearing that Drogon has n't been seen in weeks , Daario muses on the irony of a dragon-queen with no dragons .
Daario,Within the city itself , Jorah and Daario run afoul of Akho and Iggo who see through Jorah 's claims to be a wine merchant .
Daario Naharis,Also in attendance is Prendahl 's capable and striking lieutenant , Daario Naharis .
Daario Naharis,Attended by Tyrion Lannister , Missandei , and Daario Naharis , Daenerys sits in the royal box at the Daznak 's Pit .
Daario Naharis,Daenerys and Daario Naharis wake over the deceased Ser Barristan Selmy .
Daario Naharis,Her newest captain , Daario Naharis , suggests a plan using a lightly defended back gate , a small group can infiltrate the city and open the main gates for the rest of the army to invade .
Daario Naharis,Hizdahr zo Loraq and Daario Naharis return to Meereen and declare that their mission to Yunkai has been successful , and that the Wise Masters will turn over power to a council of former slaves and former slave owners .
Daario Naharis,Jorah then departs while Daenerys and Daario Naharis lead the Dothraki horde back to Meereen .
Daario Naharis,Ser Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis approach the outskirts of Vaes Dothrak and discard their weapons , as drawing a blade in the city is considered sacrilege .
Daario Naharis,She is irritated to learn that Daario Naharis has captured Meereen 's navy without her explicit orders to do so , but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for Westeros and taking King 's Landing with her 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons .
Daario Naharis,She notices Grey Worm and Daario Naharis are absent and sets out to find them after being told they are `` gambling '' .
Daenerys,A few hours later , an impatient Daenerys paces in her tent , asking Barristan how long a sacking of a city usually takes .
Daenerys,A freedman demands to know when Daenerys will return while another is appalled at the idea of Tyrion negotiating with slave traders .
Daenerys,A khalasar surrounds Daenerys .
Daenerys,After a moment , one of the freedmen stretches his hand towards Daenerys and calls out `` mhysa '' .
Daenerys,After he departs , Hizdahr zo Loraq presents his petition : the right to bury his father 's remains in the Temple of the Graces , as he was one of the Meereenese Great Masters crucified on Daenerys 's orders .
Daenerys,After taking a glance at Daenerys , Drogo rides away without having to dismount from his horse .
Daenerys,After the Sack of Astapor is finished , Daenerys walks past Kraznys ' charred remains , mounts a white horse , and addresses her Unsullied .
Daenerys,As Daenerys puts on her new clothes , she tells the high priestess that she will soon regret what she has done as she was the wife of a great khal the Queen of Meereen , and the Mother of Dragons .
Daenerys,As Daenerys tries to calm him down , without warning , Drogon snaps at her with a hiss , a warning to not interfere .
Daenerys,As Daenerys watches her brother die , she coldly states that , having been killed by fire , Viserys was no true dragon .
Daenerys,As Khal Drogo 's wound festers , Daenerys defies his bloodrider Qotho and puts her trust in the enslaved witch Mirri Maz Duur .
Daenerys,As a servant of Master Mighdal , Fennesz was well-treated and even well-respected in the household , but when Daenerys forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full-scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people .
Daenerys,As he leaves , Daenerys asks how many more supplicants are waiting ; Missandei answers that there are over 200 more .
Daenerys,As they are feeding , Daenerys personally locks huge iron collars around their necks , which are secured by heavy chains .
Daenerys,As they walk , Daenerys learns that Ornela 's khal died when she was only sixteen .
Daenerys,At Daenerys ' command , Rakharo places the dragon eggs on the pyre , and Mirri Maz Duur is tied to a stake next to the pyre as well .
Daenerys,At Daenerys ' request , Ser Jorah armors himself .
Daenerys,At one point , she pauses , wondering how to twist a particularly coarse insult from Kraznys , and Daenerys notices her reluctance to directly translate .
Daenerys,At that , Drogon and his siblings roar in anger ; Razdal protests that he was promised safe conduct , to which Daenerys counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother .
Daenerys,Attended by Tyrion Lannister , Missandei , and Daario Naharis , Daenerys sits in the royal box at the Daznak 's Pit .
Daenerys,Aware of his dislike of politics , Daenerys asks if Barristan wants to attend her in the throne room ; after being assured that Daario has her back , she gives him the day off , cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below .
Daenerys,Back at the Great Pyramid , Daenerys and her council debate executing this Harpy 's Son , but the debate devolves into a shouting match between Mossador and Hizdahr zo Loraq .
Daenerys,Barristan Selmy is optimistic about their chances , believing that old Westerosi families will flock to their cause once Daenerys crosses the Narrow Sea , swelling their numbers .
Daenerys,Barristan saves Daenerys from a deadly manticore
Daenerys,Barristan surmises Jorah spied on Daenerys in exchange for the pardon .
Daenerys,Before the creature can harm Daenerys with its lethal sting , the stranger impales it with his dagger and charges at the child , who hisses in a reptilian manner , baring teeth and features reminiscent of Pyat Pree , and uses magic to escape .
Daenerys,Bewildered , Daenerys turns to Missandei , who reveals that the word means `` mother '' in the Old Ghiscari language .
Daenerys,Catching sight of a prostitute dressed as Daenerys , Varys tells Tyrion that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting .
Daenerys,Catelyn renews an old friendship with a member of the court , while Daenerys and Viserys journey onwards to the Dothraki capital of Vaes Dothrak .

Daenerys,Daario verbally spars with Hizdahr for much of the first match , drawing Daenerys 's attention from the spectacle in front of her .
Daenerys,Daario visits Daenerys in her private chambers .
Daenerys,Daenerys demands to know why , and Mirri Maz Duur explains that when Daenerys `` saved '' her , she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the Dothraki .
Daenerys,Daenerys proceeds to explain the dangers Missandei will be facing in Daenerys 's service and asks if that will be a problem .
Daenerys,Disgusted , Daenerys issues the command that all Unsullied must choose their own new names as free men , or reclaim the names their parents gave them .
Daenerys,Doreah instructs Daenerys on how to please Drogo in bed but also how to use her skills to gain respect from him .
Daenerys,Drogo and Daenerys ride down to the shore and consummate their marriage on the beach at sunset .
Daenerys,Drogo arrives in Pentos and approves of Daenerys .
Daenerys,Drogo melts his golden belt in a pot , while Viserys begs Daenerys to help him .
Daenerys,Drunk , bitter and angry , Viserys interrupts a feast for Daenerys and Drogo .
Daenerys,Duur agrees that Daenerys saved her life , but she says to ask Drogo what life is worth when all else is gone .
Daenerys,En route back to their ship , Ser Jorah urges that Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied , arguing that under her command , these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under Kraznys and his ilk .
Daenerys,Eventually , the doors collapse and Daenerys emerges , naked and unburned , with the entire leadership present at Vaes Dothrak dead .
Daenerys,For his gift , Drogo gives Daenerys a beautiful white stallion .
Daenerys,Frustrated , Daenerys states that the honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as they did not keep her waiting all morning .
Daenerys,Given that he is half the world away from Daenerys , he also accurately deduces that she must have found out he was spying on her and had him exiled - and therefore , he kidnapped Tyrion in the hope that presenting him as a gift to Daenerys will get him back in her favor .
Daenerys,Grey Worm thinks he has failed Ser Barristan , his men and Daenerys -- a claim Missandei denies .
Daenerys,Having second thoughts , he steps in and stops Daenerys from drinking it .
Daenerys,He adds that Daenerys needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons , as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of Westeros .
Daenerys,He admits to Tyrion that the `` Queen '' he is taking him to is not Cersei but Daenerys .
Daenerys,He also advises Daenerys that conquering Yunkai does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake Westeros .
Daenerys,He also says that it 's a good time to talk to the queen , as she is in a very good mood , implying that he and Daenerys had just been intimate .
Daenerys,He angrily demands his payment in return for giving Daenerys to Drogo .
Daenerys,He begs Daenerys to send him and the Second Sons to make real war .
Daenerys,He bends the knee and swears his sword , his men and his heart to Daenerys .
Daenerys,He drags Doreah into Daenerys ' tent , and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him .
Daenerys,He explains that he is here to kill Daenerys on orders from his captains , but they ran into a `` philosophical disagreement '' over her beauty .
Daenerys,He expresses confidence that with Missandei 's help , the pair of them should be able to keep Meereen under control until they return with Daenerys .
Daenerys,He looks at Tyrion and then glances in the direction of Meereen , knowing that even if he dies , he needs to get Tyrion to Daenerys .
Daenerys,He repeatedly insults and mocks Daenerys in his native tongue , leaving his slave translator Missandei of Naath to clean up his crude and very insulting words into more respectful language .
Daenerys,He says he knows that Jorah wants Daenerys , but he does n't care .
Daenerys,He soon confesses to giving Varys information on Daenerys ' activities in Essos .
Daenerys,He starts to leave and states his plan to take his own life well before the greyscale envelops him , but Daenerys tearfully commands him to find a cure and come back to her side when she conquers Westeros .
Daenerys,He tells Daenarys that Master Mighdal's seven year old daughter Calla admires Daenerys , having learned of the Targaryen dynasty through Fennesz 's teachings .
Daenerys,He tells them that Daenerys may keep the women she has claimed , they can find others .
Daenerys,He wants Daenerys , the unborn child , and Viserys dead as soon as possible .
Daenerys,Her advisors then reveal more troubling news : the Wise Masters have bounced back and re-enslaved every freed man in Yunkai , and although Astapor remains free , the council Daenerys installed has been deposed by a butcher named Cleon .
Daenerys,Hizdahr again beseeches Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits of Meereen , because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting season .
Daenerys,Horrified , Daenerys meets with Missandei and Grey Worm in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of Meereen .
Daenerys,However , Daenerys seems not to notice it and appears to be unharmed .
Daenerys,However Daenerys is not threatened , commenting that a hard-fought battle would give her Unsullied much needed practice .
Daenerys,In Astapor , Daenerys , accompanied by Ser Jorah Mormont and Ser Barristan Selmy , walks along a sea wall known as the `` Walk of Punishment . ''
Daenerys,In Meereen , Daenerys and Daario discuss her impending marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq .
Daenerys,In Vaes Dothrak , Daenerys attempts to convince Khal Drogo about the benefits of an invasion of the Seven Kingdoms , but Drogo is reluctant to cross the Narrow Sea , despite the thousands of ships they could find in the Free Cities to do the job .
Daenerys,In an audience before her , a seething Daenerys demands an explanation , and Jorah says it is a ploy by Tywin Lannister to divide them .
Daenerys,In exchange , the Wise Masters have asked that Daenerys consent to the reopening of the fighting pits , an arena where slaves used to fight to the death .
Daenerys,In exchange , they ask that Daenerys leave Yunkai in peace .
Daenerys,In her new headquarters atop the Great Pyramid , Daenerys learns that Joffrey is dead and Tommen has been crwoned .

Daenerys,Intrigued , Daenerys rises from her bath and asks if Daario will swear fealty to her .
Daenerys,Irri takes the egg from her , but Daenerys is completely unharmed , and it is Irri who suffers scalding burns on her own hands .
Daenerys,It is night , and Daenerys is in their tent tending to Drogo .
Daenerys,It is only when the Dothraki are chanting Rhaego 's name , and Drogo lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room , that Viserys realizes they love her .
Daenerys,Joffrey is puzzled at why Tywin does n't think they should do anything about her , but Tywin reminds Joffrey that the last Targaryen dragons were stunted inbred creatures who were n't a threat to anyone , and Daenerys ' dragons are probably just curiosities at best , not grand weapons of war .
Daenerys,Jorah 's report that Daenerys was pregnant is what made Robert demand that Daenerys be assassinated at a Small Council meeting with Ned Stark .
Daenerys,Jorah Mormont helps Daenerys .
Daenerys,Jorah also advises her to leave now , because Drogo is certain to die and when he dies , his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor ; whoever wins will kill Daenerys 's son , rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival , but Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband .
Daenerys,Jorah and Barristan briefly bicker about the fact that Barristan only just came to them , while Jorah was defending Daenerys from Robert Baratheon 's assassins for months , and Barristan is n't Lord Commander here ; Jorah takes his orders from Daenerys .
Daenerys,Jorah and Barristan continue to disagree on whether or not Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied .
Daenerys,Jorah and Daario evacuate Daenerys from the royal box , while Tyrion rescues Missandei .
Daenerys,Jorah and the rest of the khalasar awake to find Daenerys sitting among the still smoldering embers , with three newly-hatched baby dragons crawling over her .
Daenerys,Jorah begs for her forgiveness , but Daenerys rebuffs him , saying he betrayed her , selling her secrets to the man she holds responsible for the death of her family .
Daenerys,Jorah explains that he never used to believe in things like destiny and was very cynical , but after seeing Daenerys emerge from the flames unharmed with baby dragons , he believes in her now , and the Iron Throne is hers by right .
Daenerys,Jorah finally confesses his love for Daenerys , but also reveals his spreading greyscale infection , and says that this time , he needs to leave for good .
Daenerys,Jorah finds Daenerys , in the company of Kovarro , pleading with the council of The Thirteen to find her dragons .
Daenerys,Jorah is not amused , but Daenerys dismisses concerns about her intimate life .
Daenerys,Jorah is relieved that Barristan was therefore not present at any council meeting so he could n't have learned that Jorah was sending it reports on Daenerys .
Daenerys,Jorah relates to the mercy shown by Eddard Stark for his dealings in slavery and convinces Daenerys to bring the masters to justice without execution .
Daenerys,Jorah seems to find these threats rather reckless , but one of the Thirteen , Xaro Xhoan Daxos , chooses to vouch for Daenerys through Sumai , a blood oath by which a Qartheen may vouch for a visitor .
Daenerys,Jorah shows his arm to Daenerys .
Daenerys,Jorah then begins to subtly ask about the advisors on the Small Council , if any of them spoke against Robert when he wanted Daenerys , the last Targaryen , assassinated .
Daenerys,Jorah then departs while Daenerys and Daario Naharis lead the Dothraki horde back to Meereen .
Daenerys,Jorah then protests that his actions stopped her from being poisoned , but Daenerys retorts this was only because he knew it might be coming .
Daenerys,Just as Daenerys thought she would conquer the world at Drogo 's side , so did the high priestess think she would conquer the world at Savo 's .
Daenerys,Kraznys also demonstrates that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier ( much to Daenerys 's disgust ) , who not only shows no sign of pain , but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him .
Daenerys,Kraznys frantically shouts for someone to kill Daenerys , to which she calmly orders `` dracarys . ''
Daenerys,Kraznys tells Daenerys , via Missandei 's interpretation in the Low Valyrian language , that many of the Unsullied have not yet seen battle , so she would do well to attack some minor cities and towns here and there on her way to Westeros .
Daenerys,Later , Daario convinces her to reconsider , as his youth fighting in the pits gave him the fighting skills necessary for him to join the Second Sons , where he met Daenerys .
Daenerys,Later , Daenerys attempts to visit Viserion and Rhaegal , whom she locked underground in the Meereenese catacombs to prevent them from killing innocents or fleeing ( both of which Drogon did ) .

Daenerys,Meanwhile , Daenerys finds herself far away from Meereen , atop an impressive hill in a sea of green grass .
Daenerys,Meanwhile , Tywin offers to work for the common good with a presumed enemy ; Sam takes stock of the personnel at Castle Black ; the Hound gives another life lesson to Arya ; and Daenerys makes a decision outside the walls of Meereen .
Daenerys,Meanwhile , the High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen gives Daenerys a commentary on the other crones .
Daenerys,Mirri Maz Duur does indeed scream as she burns , and Daenerys calmly walks into the flames .
Daenerys,Missandei Daenerys watches on as her dragons set a head of great family on fire and proceed to eat him .
Daenerys,Missandei and Grey Worm tell Tyrion that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating ever since Daenerys left .
Daenerys,Missandei begins to tell them of how Daenerys the Unburnt freed them , but Daenerys interrupts and says that it is the slaves ' own choice to reach for their freedom .
Daenerys,Missandei only says that she has seen Daenerys listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong .
Daenerys,Missandei says she does n't know , to which Daenerys asks if she 's ever wondered .
Daenerys,Missandei says this should n't be that odd , since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of Dothraki .
Daenerys,Mollified by the revelation , particularly that her crazed father always thought his atrocities were serving justice to his enemies , Daenerys promises Ser Barristan that there will be a trial for the accused .
Daenerys,Moreover , Tywin says that even if Daenerys ' dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago , they are on the far side of the world and no threat to Joffrey 's rule .
Daenerys,Ned 's position is already precarious due to a disagreement with King Robert Baratheon over plans to assassinate Daenerys before she can rally the Dothraki to invade Westeros .

Daenerys,On the road to Meereen , Daenerys speaks with Missandei , who tells her queen that Meereen would be wise to fear her approach .
Daenerys,Once the sellswords are gone , Daenerys drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at Mero 's back , instructs Barristan that if they must fight the Second Sons , he is to kill Mero first .
Daenerys,Prendahl and Mero refuse Daenerys ' offer of an alliance , pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the Iron Throne , which is still a distant prospect .
Daenerys,Pyat Pree urges Daenerys to find her dragons at the House of the Undying as the three flee .
Daenerys,Quaithe knows that Jorah once betrayed Daenerys by spying on her .
Daenerys,Quaithe warns Jorah that the man who stole the dragons is already with Daenerys .
Daenerys,Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons , Daenerys tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city .
Daenerys,Returning with Xaro Xhoan Daxos to his mansion , Daenerys finds her guards dead , Irri strangled to death , and her dragons missing .
Daenerys,Sam praises Daenerys 's courage but Maester Aemon worries about his great-niece 's safety because she is all alone , under siege , and with hardly anyone to guide her , while her `` last relation '' is useless and dying thousands of miles away .
Daenerys,Seeing Daenerys with a wineseller who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the Arbor , Jorah realizes that the wine has been poisoned ; this is the assassination attempt .
Daenerys,Seeing they are hopelessly outnumbered , Daenerys takes Missandei 's hand and closes her eyes , ready to face her death .
Daenerys,Ser Barristan Selmy warns Daenerys that the masters will assuredly take advantage of this , quickly making `` contracts '' with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but name .
Daenerys,Ser Barristan offers to have outriders go ahead to bury them , but Daenerys refuses , ordering that each of them be buried , and their collars removed , but not before she has looked upon each and every face .
Daenerys,Ser Jorah and others try to explain this to Daenerys , but she is disturbed to see the aftermath , the Dothraki killing the villagers and raping their women , and orders it stopped .
Daenerys,Ser Jorah believes that Daenerys intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider , as they can sell the eggs and travel far away .
Daenerys,She explains that all the khalasars have gathered to decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved , and now they will have to decide what to do with Daenerys for not coming to the dosh khaleen after Khal Drogo died .
Daenerys,She has now gotten her revenge , not only on Drogo , but on Daenerys ' child Rhaego ; now her `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents .
Daenerys,She is now content , just as Daenerys would be if she is allowed to join them .
Daenerys,She says no , and Daenerys mentions that Dothraki have no taboos against nudity or public love-making .
Daenerys,Shortly thereafter , Daenerys hosts the captains Mero , a Braavosi also known as the Titan 's Bastard , and Prendahl na Ghezn , a Ghiscari .
Daenerys,Some of Drogo 's warriors become enraged at what they see as Daenerys ' attempts to interfere with the natural way of things and Qotho tries to attack her , but Ser Jorah kills him .
Daenerys,Some of them hate Daenerys , thinking the Dothraki should not interbreed with other races , but the high priestess dismisses them , saying that the Dothraki have always interbred and have never been concerned with blood purity .
Daenerys,Somewhat mollified , Daenerys allows him to bury his father .
Daenerys,Stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the Dothraki , Daenerys declares that she will lead them herself .
Daenerys,Telling her dragons to fly , Daenerys steps out of the protection of the Unsullied and into the crowd , who carry on their chanting .
Daenerys,That night , as Daenerys bathes , she is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks no fewer than nineteen languages .
Daenerys,The Night 's Watch takes stock ; Varys meets his better ; Arya is taken to the commander of the Brotherhood ; Daenerys makes an exchange .
Daenerys,The Sons rally enough to attack Drogon with spears , which Daenerys hastily makes an effort to remove .
Daenerys,The Thirteen decide to turn Daenerys ' group away and abandon them to the Garden of Bones .
Daenerys,The Unsullied proceed to sack the entire city , slaughtering the slave masters and freeing fellow slaves , supported by the fire of Daenerys ' dragons .
Daenerys,The Yunkish herald is carried into Daenerys 's camp on a litter carried by slaves , along a road flanked by Unsullied .
Daenerys,The child is dead , her hand pointing the way to Meereen , and Ser Jorah tells Daenerys there is one for each mile to the last of the great slave cities , 163 in total .
Daenerys,The child offers a gift to Daenerys - a wooden ball - but as she picks it up , the hooded stranger knocks it out of her hands ; Ser Jorah grabs the stranger and their struggle knocks Daenerys to the ground , where to her horror , the ball cracks in half and a manticore emerges to attack .
Daenerys,The crones declare Daenerys and Drogo 's son will be `` The Stallion That Mounts The World '' , a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in Dothraki history .

Daenerys,The masked woman Quaithe delivers an enigmatic warning to Ser Jorah Mormont about Daenerys 's need for protection from those who lust after her dragons .
Daenerys,The next supplicant then enters , a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms , similarly to the herdsman who came to show the bones of their livestock which Daenerys 's dragons burned in order to be reimbursed .
Daenerys,The other members of the council - Pycelle , Renly , Littlefinger and Varys - all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm .
Daenerys,The three argue about Jorah 's betrayal , but they will not make any judgments without Daenerys first .
Daenerys,The uncouth and sexually vulgar Mero makes himself at home , observes that Daenerys looks like a whore he knows in Lys and feels up Missandei , although the surprisingly gracious queen shrugs his insults off .
Daenerys,The wine seller is captured after trying to poison Daenerys .
Daenerys,Their talk turns to Daenerys , and Jorah says that Barristan can believe in her .
Daenerys,Then one starts tapping the end of his spear against the ground in support , and the others join in , until thousands of Unsullied are triumphantly striking their spears against the ground in praise of Daenerys .
Daenerys,Therefore , he has come to Daenerys to beg her permission to sell himself back to Mighdal .
Daenerys,They discuss the role of Varys in their stories and Tyrion assures Daenerys he trusts him , and that he 's probably the reason she was n't killed years ago .
Daenerys,They eventually decide to simply assassinate Daenerys and be done with it .

Dorne,He states Dorne will not stoop to the level of mutilating children while he rules , even if the Sand Snakes are siding with Ellaria .
Dorne,In Dorne
Dorne,Jaime explains to Bronn that he bribed the captain to let them take a small boat to shore as they pass Dorne , and they will land just outside of Sunspear and the adjacent Water Gardens .
Dorne,Jaime notes that Myrcella is wearing a revealing Dornish-style dress now , and she says that the warm climate of Dorne agrees with her .
Dorne,Myrcella 's corpse arrives from Dorne .
Dorne,Qyburn tries to win the favor of the children by attracting them with candied plums from Dorne .
Dorne,She informs them that Prince Doran Martell will not raise Dorne 's armies to avenge his brother 's death .
Dorne,The Pentoshi ship captain found her in Planky Town , and as Bronn feared , he indeed tried to sell her information about Jaime Lannister 's arrival in Dorne .
Dorne,The royal court including King Joffrey Baratheon , Queen Regent Cersei Lannister , Prince Tommen Baratheon , and Sansa Stark are at the docks seeing off Princess Myrcella Baratheon as she departs in a ship bound for Dorne .
Dorne,To support his testimony , Olyvar tells the High Sparrow of a birthmark Loras has that is shaped like Dorne , much to Loras ' shock and fury .
Dorne,While in bed together , Loras and the male prostitute Olyvar contemplate a birthmark on Loras 's thigh which looks a little like Dorne .
Dornish,Bronn , having finished off the other sentries , notes that they now have their horses : fine Dornish sand steeds , capable of running a day and a night without tiring .
Dornish,Tyrion quizzes Bronn on the sigils of the Dornish houses , none of which he knows , however Podrick answers perfectly .
Dornish,Tywin observes that only the Dornish successfully resisted Aegon Targaryen 's dragons during his invasion of Westeros three centuries ago ; Oberyn dryly notes it must be hard for Tywin to admit he needs the Dornish for help .
Dosh,When Daenerys asks to be escorted back to Meereen in exchange for the promise of one thousand horses for her safe return , Moro 's wife tells her that she has to remain in the temple of Vaes Dothrak with the other Khals ' widows for the remainder of her days and become a Dosh khaleen .
Dothraki,Angered , he begins to yell out in Dothraki that his army will cross the `` poison water '' as no khalasar has done before and take the Iron Throne for his son .
Dothraki,At the city of Astapor in Slaver 's Bay , Daenerys Targaryen arrives before Kraznys mo Nakloz and the other slave-masters of the city , with her Dothraki guards carrying the largest of her dragons , Drogon , in its large cage .
Dothraki,At the sight of the mythical animals born anew , an amazed Jorah and the few remaining Dothraki kneel and swear their allegiance to the Mother of Dragons .
Dothraki,Catelyn renews an old friendship with a member of the court , while Daenerys and Viserys journey onwards to the Dothraki capital of Vaes Dothrak .
Dothraki,Daenerys Targaryen walks with the Dothraki towards Vaes Dothrak and is ushered into the the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen by Khal Moro 's bloodriders .
Dothraki,Daenerys calms the situation and Viserys is forced to walk , a sign of shame amongst the horse-riding Dothraki .
Dothraki,Daenerys demands to know why , and Mirri Maz Duur explains that when Daenerys `` saved '' her , she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the Dothraki .
Dothraki,Daenerys expresses interest in expanding her tiny Dothraki khalasar ( most of them are seasick because the Dothraki have never traveled on ships before ) , but Jorah says that other Dothraki will only join her if they think she is strong , and for that she needs an army .
Dothraki,Daenerys is shown walking with her hands bound , and two Dothraki take her to Khal Moro as a gift .
Dothraki,Daenerys nervously puts these plans into action and is surprised to find Drogo responsive , particularly once she starts using her body in combination with the Dothraki language to speak to him .
Dothraki,Daenerys starts to go into labor , but none of the Dothraki midwives will help her , thinking she is cursed .
Dothraki,Daenerys wanders away to find something for them , but is thrown to see a trio of Dothraki bloodriders emerge .
Dothraki,Dany 's Dothraki handmaidens Irri and Jhiqui dismiss the story , saying that the moon is a goddess , wife to the sun .
Dothraki,Dany is forced to reconcile her desire to conquer Westeros with Drogo 's savagery after the Dothraki raid a peaceful village .
Dothraki,Dany proves to the Dothraki who their true Khaleesi is .
Dothraki,Dany reminds them that her husband , in the same temple in which they all now sit , declared that he would lead a Dothraki army across the Narrow Sea to retake the Iron Throne for his khaleesi and that all the khals have done since is to raid and plunder villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest .
Dothraki,Eddard points out that the Dothraki can not cross the Narrow Sea , as they have no ships , but Robert is concerned that the Seven Kingdoms will soon face another war .
Dothraki,He falls from his horse , a grave sign of weakness amongst the Dothraki .
Dothraki,He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from Pentos , having refused to dress like a Dothraki , whom he regards as savage pordh .
Dothraki,He is strangled by Rakharo , a Dothraki warrior wielding a whip .
Dothraki,He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a Dothraki .
Dothraki,However , when Bran gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery , Luwin suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow , of the kind used in mounted combat by the Dothraki , a notion which pleases Bran .
Dothraki,Irri is devastated by the death and believes the mutilation will prevent Rakharo from entering the Night Lands , the Dothraki land of the dead .
Dothraki,It is only when the Dothraki are chanting Rhaego 's name , and Drogo lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room , that Viserys realizes they love her .
Dothraki,Jorah then departs while Daenerys and Daario Naharis lead the Dothraki horde back to Meereen .
Dothraki,Khal Drogo 's khalasar arrives at Vaes Dothrak , the Dothraki city .
Dothraki,Meanwhile , a Braavosi Water Dancer easily dispatches his Dothraki opponent , and then focuses his attention on Jorah .
Dothraki,Missandei says this should n't be that odd , since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of Dothraki .
Dothraki,Ned 's position is already precarious due to a disagreement with King Robert Baratheon over plans to assassinate Daenerys before she can rally the Dothraki to invade Westeros .
Dothraki,Of course , Missandei is not Dothraki , but she says it does n't matter , as Grey Worm is n't interested in her - none of the Unsullied desire women .
Dothraki,On Jorah 's orders , the Dothraki seize Xaro 's gold and jewels while Daenerys triumphantly watches with her three dragons .
Dothraki,On the eastern continent , the exiled Princess Daenerys Targaryen marries Khal Drogo , a warlord of the Dothraki with tens of thousands of warriors at his command .
Dothraki,Robert agrees , but if they land and the knights of Westeros take shelter behind their castle walls , the Dothraki could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept Viserys as their king regardless .
Dothraki,Ser Jorah Mormont and Rakharo compare the Westerosi and Dothraki ways of battle ; the heavily-armored but slow knights versus the lightly-armored but fast-moving horse-warriors .
Dothraki,Ser Jorah and others try to explain this to Daenerys , but she is disturbed to see the aftermath , the Dothraki killing the villagers and raping their women , and orders it stopped .
Dothraki,Several people die in impromptu duels , which Illyrio says is a good sign : a Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair .
Dothraki,She says no , and Daenerys mentions that Dothraki have no taboos against nudity or public love-making .
Dothraki,She tells a thunderstruck Viserys that she is the Khal 's wife , and is carrying his child ( and by implication , Viserys is nothing to the Dothraki ) , and warns that if he raises a hand against her again , he will lose his hands .
Dothraki,Some of them hate Daenerys , thinking the Dothraki should not interbreed with other races , but the high priestess dismisses them , saying that the Dothraki have always interbred and have never been concerned with blood purity .
Dothraki,Stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the Dothraki , Daenerys declares that she will lead them herself .
Dothraki,Surprisingly , Cersei takes Eddard 's side , pointing out that the Dothraki can not cross the Narrow Sea as they have no ships .
Dothraki,The Dothraki grow angry at not being able to take the spoils of victory , as that is the Dothraki way .
Dothraki,The Dothraki khalasar led by Khal Drogo have departed Pentos and are heading east .
Dothraki,The Dothraki raid a village in Lhazar , a peaceful country to the south-east of Vaes Dothrak .
Dothraki,The crones declare Daenerys and Drogo 's son will be `` The Stallion That Mounts The World '' , a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in Dothraki history .
Dothraki,The khaleesi bristles at the idea she speaks only reasonable Dothraki and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson , only to have her pronunciation corrected .
Dothraki,They note numerous hoof prints on the ground , making Jorah realize that the Dothraki have been here .
Dothraki,They travel away from the Free Cities and into the Dothraki sea , the long-grassed plains that the Dothraki call home .
Dothraki,Viserys has arranged to wed his sister Daenerys ( also called `` Dany '' ) to Khal Drogo , the warlord of a Dothraki khalasar of forty thousand warriors .
Dothraki,Viserys tells Ser Jorah that to rule one must be feared or loved , and he has never been loved as the Dothraki love Dany .
Dothraki Sea,In the Dothraki Sea
Dracarys,She calmly utters a single word : '' Dracarys '' ; after a couple of tries , all three dragons unleash their fiery breath , and Pyat Pree is incinerated .
Dragon,In his anger , Viserys tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her , calling her nothing but a `` horselord 's slut '' , and warning her that she 's `` awoken the Dragon '' , but this time she fights back , hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt .
Dragon Queen,Like another Red Priestess , she preaches of a prophesied savior , a Dragon Queen .
Dragonglass,He hopes the White Walkers ca n't climb the Wall as there is not enough Dragonglass or Valyrian steel in Westeros to combat them .
Dragonglass,Leaf approaches and forces a Dragonglass dagger into the captive 's chest .
Dragons,Daenerys marches forward with her army and Dragons .
Dragonstone,At Dragonstone

Dragonstone,In Dragonstone , mercy comes from strange quarters .
Dragonstone,In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to Lord Stannis and instructs a courier to take the message to Dragonstone , Stannis 's island fortress .
Dragonstone,Later that night , Shireen sneaks down to the dungeon of Dragonstone and finds the cell of `` Ser Onion Knight . ''
Dragonstone,Melisandre finally arrives back at Dragonstone with Gendry in tow .
Dragonstone,Most of Stannis ' army has been destroyed , and the only reason the Lannisters have n't attacked Dragonstone yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at Blackwater that they can not yet mount an amphibious assault .
Dragonstone,On Dragonstone , Davos recruits the Lysene sellsail Salladhor Saan and his fleet of thirty ships to King Stannis Baratheon 's cause .

Dragonstone,Stannis begins to apologise for dragging her along on campaign with him , as Castle Black is hardly a place for a child , but Shireen cuts him off ; she is happy to have come , having expected to be left at Dragonstone , as Selyse had made it clear she wanted .
Dragonstone,Stannis muses that it is abundantly available in Dragonstone .
Dragonstone Isle,On Dragonstone Isle , Stannis Baratheon learns of Joffrey 's death and warns Ser Davos that their time to lay claim to the Iron throne dwindles if no army can be secured to wage war again .
Dreadfort,A Lannister army marching north could easily overwhelm the Bolton troops at Winterfell and the Dreadfort .
Dreadfort,At the Dreadfort
Dreadfort,At the Dreadfort , Ramsay Snow eats his breakfast of a thick sausage , taunting Theon about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and blood-stained trousers , and laughing as Theon finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare .

Drogo,Daenerys and her small retinue prepare a funeral pyre for Drogo .
Drogo,Daenerys is not pleased with the arrangement and blurts out that she does not want to marry Drogo .

Drogo,Drunk , bitter and angry , Viserys interrupts a feast for Daenerys and Drogo .
Drogo,Duur agrees that Daenerys saved her life , but she says to ask Drogo what life is worth when all else is gone .
Drogo,For his gift , Drogo gives Daenerys a beautiful white stallion .
Drogo,He angrily demands his payment in return for giving Daenerys to Drogo .
Drogo,He is so weak and ineffectual that he could n't command an army even if Drogo gave him one , to which Jorah agrees .
Drogo,Her brother , Viserys , callously plans to win Drogo 's allegiance with the marriage , so that he may return home to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne , which was seized by force from his father by Robert .
Drogo,However , Drogo lives .
Drogo,In Vaes Dothrak , Daenerys attempts to convince Khal Drogo about the benefits of an invasion of the Seven Kingdoms , but Drogo is reluctant to cross the Narrow Sea , despite the thousands of ships they could find in the Free Cities to do the job .
Drogo,In return , Drogo will give Viserys the army he needs to reclaim the Iron Throne .
Drogo,It is night , and Daenerys is in their tent tending to Drogo .
Drogo,It is only when the Dothraki are chanting Rhaego 's name , and Drogo lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room , that Viserys realizes they love her .
Drogo,Jorah also advises her to leave now , because Drogo is certain to die and when he dies , his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor ; whoever wins will kill Daenerys 's son , rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival , but Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband .

Drogo,Qotho is unhappy with entrusting Drogo 's care to the woman , whom he calls a maegi or witch , but relents .
Drogo,She finds Drogo and what would have been her infant son Rhaego .
Drogo,She has now gotten her revenge , not only on Drogo , but on Daenerys ' child Rhaego ; now her `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents .
Drogo,She takes Drogo 's horse into his tent and starts the ceremony , slitting the animal 's throat over Drogo 's comatose form .
Drogo,She then walks through the gates of the Wall surrounded by more snow , and into Drogo 's tent .

Drogo,Then he draws his sword , which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city , and threatens Dany and the unborn child , while Irri translates to Drogo .
Drogo,Though Drogo dismisses it as a scratch , Daenerys insists it be treated and allows one of the women she rescued , a healer called Mirri Maz Duur to treat the wound , despite the distaste of Drogo 's bloodriders , who derisively call the woman maegi ( a witch ) .
Drogo,Viserys Targaryen accompanies the khalasar , meaning to stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and provides him with an army with which to invade Westeros , despite Ser Jorah Mormont 's suggestion .
Drogo,Viserys adds that he would let her be raped by all forty thousand of Drogo 's men and their horses if it meant getting his throne back .
Drogo,Viserys asks his sister to make Drogo happy .
Drogo,Viserys insists that she will , because in return Drogo will give him the army he needs to retake their father 's throne from Robert Baratheon .
Drogo,Viserys is annoyed that Drogo has been taking 'his ' army in the wrong direction .
Drogon,As Daenerys tries to calm him down , without warning , Drogon snaps at her with a hiss , a warning to not interfere .
Drogon,At that , Drogon and his siblings roar in anger ; Razdal protests that he was promised safe conduct , to which Daenerys counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother .
Drogon,At that moment , a draconic screech pierces the air , and Drogon descends upon the arena , flying out of a giant flame burst .
Drogon,At the city of Astapor in Slaver 's Bay , Daenerys Targaryen arrives before Kraznys mo Nakloz and the other slave-masters of the city , with her Dothraki guards carrying the largest of her dragons , Drogon , in its large cage .

Drogon,Jorah is struck silent too , as Drogon is even bigger and more majestic than when he left .
Drogon,Later , Daenerys attempts to visit Viserion and Rhaegal , whom she locked underground in the Meereenese catacombs to prevent them from killing innocents or fleeing ( both of which Drogon did ) .
Drogon,Many of the Sons scatter in terror as Drogon bites , crushes and mercilessly burns the nearest ones to death .
Drogon,Suddenly , Drogon ( now the size of a horse ) appears and burns the field and kills a flock of goats while taking one with him .
Drogon,Suddenly , through the fog , they see Drogon fly into view .
Drogon,The Sons of the Harpy routed for now , Daario , Jorah , Missandei and Tyrion look on in astonishment as Drogon soars away .
Drogon,The Sons rally enough to attack Drogon with spears , which Daenerys hastily makes an effort to remove .
Drogon,To her relief , Drogon , now the size of a small house , has alighted just above her balcony .
Drogon,Trying to get Drogon out of the Sons ' range , Daenerys climbs atop his back and bids him to fly ( `` Valahd '' ) , becoming the first Targaryen dragonrider in over a century .
Drogon,Upon hearing that Drogon has n't been seen in weeks , Daario muses on the irony of a dragon-queen with no dragons .
Drowned God,Balon tells him that he 's surprised that he 's still alive , and Euron mocks the Drowned God , telling Balon that he is the Drowned God .

Drowned Priest,Theon considers warning Robb about his father 's actions , but ultimately reaffirms his loyalty to his family by being baptised by a Drowned Priest .
East,He explains that he is eager to bring Dorne back into the fold , wanting to unite the Seven Kingdoms against more obvious threats ; the Greyjoys are in rebellion , a Wildling army is advancing on the Wall , and there is a Targaryen girl in the East with a powerful army and three dragons , who will eventually threaten Westeros .

Eastwatch-by-the-Sea,When Stannis suggests appointing Alliser Thorne as the new commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea , Jon retorts that `` it is better to have your enemies close by than far away . ''
Edd,Afterwards , Jon takes off his cloak and hands it to the confused Edd .
Edd,At Castle Black , Thorne defends his treason while Edd and Davos defend themselves .
Edd,At the Fist of the First Men , Sam , Grenn and Edd are foraging for fuel when they hear three horn blasts ; the warning call for White Walkers .
Edd,Before the mutineers can break in , however , Edd returns with Tormund Giantsbane and an army of wildlings .
Edd,Davos asks if Edd trusts any of his brothers , and Edd replies , `` The ones in this room . ''
Edd,Davos convinces Edd to go bring Ghost in , deciding that they need all the help they can get .
Edd,Davos responds they are hopelessly outnumbered , stating Ghost is n't enough when Edd brings him up , before reminding them there are others nearby who owe Jon their lives .
Edd,Even Jon 's friend Edd rejects this decision , stating that the wildlings killed their friends Grenn and Pyp .
Edd,Grenn and Edd are shoveling pig-shit , but the former rapist Rast urges them that they are not safe here and can not trust Craster : the man sacrifices his own newborn sons to the White Walkers , and there 's every probability that if the White Walkers do come , he 'll hand over the Night 's Watch survivors to his real masters .
Edd,Grenn and Edd do n't want to discuss it .
Edd,In response , Edd states he does n't care because Jon was his friend and they butchered him , then he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out Thorne in revenge .
Edd,Jon , Edd , Tormund and the remaining defenders flee for their lives .
Edd,Jon then says Edd can do whatever he wants with the cloak , unofficially designating Edd as the 999th Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch .
Edd,Pypar and Edd try to comfort Sam by saying she might be alive and hiding , as she has survived worse situations , such as living with Craster , making a long march to the Wall , and even surviving a White Walker .
Edd,Realizing he means the Wildlings , Edd instructs them to bar the door and not let anyone in while he sneaks out to get help .
Edd,Sam is upset that Grenn and Edd abandoned him at the start of the attack , although they refuse to leave him now .
Edd,Ser Davos finds Jon 's dead body just before Edd and some other brothers arrive .
Edd,The giant appears unwilling to hand it over and asks Edd `` The fuck you looking at ? ''
Edd,They are interrupted when two rangers , Edd and Grenn , arrive back at Castle Black after escaping Craster 's Keep .
Edd,They take the body inside where Edd clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing Jon 's eyes .
Eddard,'Littlefinger ' Petyr Baelish , and Grand Maester Pycelle are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and Eddard 's actions against the Lannisters , but Eddard wants to see justice done .

Eddard,As Eddard is packing , Littlefinger arrives and offers to take Eddard to the last place Jon Arryn went before he `` fell ill '' .

Eddard,At the Eyrie , Catelyn is furious with Lysa : first for Lysa not immediately notifying her about Eddard 's arrest and second for refusing to consider summoning the knights of the Vale to war .
Eddard,At the meeting of the small council , King Robert tells Eddard that Daenerys Targaryen is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the Iron Throne .

Eddard,Cersei visits Eddard at his chambers , remarking at how the Hand is not at his own tournament .

Eddard,He calls Eddard an honorable and true man , maybe the only one in the city .
Eddard,He departs , telling Eddard he wants his brother back .
Eddard,He is incredulous that Eddard trusted Littlefinger over him , and even more so that he warned Cersei what he was going to do .

Eddard,Instead , the City Watch kill Eddard 's bodyguards and Littlefinger holds a knife to his throat , saying , `` I did warn you not to trust me . ''
Eddard,Jaime acknowledges that this is true , so he says he will settle for killing Eddard 's men instead .
Eddard,Jaime asserts that he has only been with Cersei and begins to ridicule Eddard Stark , Catelyn 's late husband , by bringing up the shame of Eddard fathering a bastard .
Eddard,Jaime is still unhappy that Eddard judged him dishonorable for killing the Mad King , the murderer of Eddard 's father and brother .

Eddard,Leaving the chamber , Eddard talks to Varys , who slyly points out that Lancel Lannister ensured the King kept `` refreshed '' with alcohol during the hunt , meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable .
Eddard,Littlefinger fetches Eddard to meet his wife , but Eddard suspects a trick and pushes Littlefinger up against a wall outside the brothel wanting to know what his game is .
Eddard,Littlefinger meets with Eddard and suggests that he keep his investigation into Jon Arryn 's death lower in profile .

Eddard,Petyr talks with Eddard .
Eddard,Renly finds Eddard and tells him that Robert has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive .

Eddard,Robert agrees , but offers a sweetener : the hand of his son , Joffrey , in marriage to Eddard 's daughter , Sansa .
Eddard,Robert formally offers Eddard the role of Hand , and Eddard asks for time to consider .
Eddard,Robert instructs Eddard to take a letter naming him as the Lord Protector of the Realm , to rule until Joffrey comes of age .
Eddard,Robert is adamant about fighting in the joust but Eddard tells him that he is too fat for his armor and the other knights would let him win .
Eddard,Ser Ilyn draws Eddard 's own sword , Ice , and cuts his head off with a single blow .
Eddard,She goes back to balancing on one leg as Eddard looks on .
Eddard,She wants Robert to take action against him , but Robert refuses to condemn him without hearing Eddard 's side , and tells her to be silent .
Eddard,So she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all night , praying to the gods that if they forgave her earlier wish that Jon would die , she promised she would urge Eddard to have Jon legitimized as a Stark and she would raise him as her own son .
Eddard,Stannis proclaims that Eddard was an honorable man , and asks Jon what Ned would have done with Mance .

Eddard,Surprisingly , Cersei takes Eddard 's side , pointing out that the Dothraki can not cross the Narrow Sea as they have no ships .

Eddard,They have had word from King 's Landing about Eddard 's injury , Jory 's death and Tyrion 's capture .
Eddard,This gives Eddard pause and sends him back to the book that Jon Arryn was looking at before he died .
Eddard,Though Cersei attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the Kingsroad behind them , Eddard correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit .

Gendry,Gendry has finished fixing a steel breastplate which Thoros puts on , and Arya asks why Gendry is helping them .
Gendry,Gendry says he 's been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it : he worked most of his life for Tobho Mott and he repaid Gendry by selling him to the Night 's Watch ( as soon as the secret payments from Varys ended ) , and he `` served '' Tywin Lannister as a prisoner at Harrenhal , every day afraid he 'd be killed or tortured .
Gendry,Gendry says he used to work as a smith in King 's Landing for Tobho Mott , whom Thoros recognizes but says he charged double what the other smiths did ; Gendry counters that 's because it was double the quality .
Gendry,He 'd be serving in the Brotherhood too , but they chose Beric as their leader , and they 're more like a family - and as a common-born tavern maiden 's son who was orphaned at a young age , Gendry has never had a family .
Gendry,He argues with Stannis again about sacrificing the boy , but Stannis is convinced by Melisandre that using Gendry as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the Iron Throne .

Gendry,He confronts Ser Amory and refuses to comply with his demands that he surrender the Royal bastard Gendry .
Gendry,He expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word `` night '' , before hearing the horns that signal Melisandre 's intents to sacrifice Gendry .
Gendry,He had been working for Tobho Mott , but with Robert dead , the secret funds being sent to Mott stopped , so he fired Gendry and told him he had to join the Night 's Watch .
Gendry,He says that Gendry can be identified by his bull 's head helm .
Gendry,In Gendry 's quarters , Melisandre seduces Gendry long enough to distract him , then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body .
Gendry,In response , Gendry politely but firmly points out that the class differences between them mean that if he goes back with her , they 'd never be family : he 'd still be a commoner , and she 'd be `` m'lady . ''

Gendry,Tywin counsels the king , and Melisandre reveals a secret to Gendry .
Gendry,Tywin orders an immediate halt to the tortures ( saving Gendry ) , rationally pointing out how disproportionate it is relative to what little wealth the peasants might be hiding , and it would be far more efficient to put them to work around the castle .
Genna,Tyrion and Bronn then lead Pod into another room of the brothel , where Tyrion says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the Battle of the Blackwater : he has paid for Podrick ( who has never had sex with a woman ) to enjoy the services of not one , but three prostitutes : Marei , Genna , and a contortionist named Kayla ( one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a `` Meereenese Knot '' ) .

Ghost,Davos convinces Edd to go bring Ghost in , deciding that they need all the help they can get .
Ghost,Davos responds they are hopelessly outnumbered , stating Ghost is n't enough when Edd brings him up , before reminding them there are others nearby who owe Jon their lives .
Ghost,In response to Rast 's comments , Jon goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf Ghost to intimidate Rast into playing along .
Ghost,Jon names his Ghost , for his white color and uncanny silence .
Ghost,Just then , a wight approaches Sam and is about to attack him with an axe when the direwolf Ghost knocks it down .

Gregor,Sandor confirms the story of his facial scars from burns inflicted by Gregor 's wrath and how his father covered up the truth , making him feel alone .

Grenn,Mance ruefully notes that the giant was named Mag the Mighty , and he was `` king '' of the giants , the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the First Men entered Westeros , to which Jon then glibly notes that his friend Grenn was from a farm .
Grenn,Mance then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out , and Jon informs Mance that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend Grenn .
Grenn,Much to Thorne and Slynt 's surprise , Grenn , Eddison Tollett and a group of other men join Jon on his mission , including Locke who asks to say his vows if that is required before he goes north of the Wall .

Jaime,Cersei summons Jaime to their late father 's office and reveals a `` gift '' from Dorne : an ornately carved viper , with Princess Myrcella 's unique Lannister pendant suspended from its fangs .
Jaime,Cersei told Oberyn and his sister that Tyrion killed her mother , and then cruelly assaulted Tyrion until Jaime stopped her .
Jaime,Coming to the point , Doran asks Jaime why he has snuck in to Dorne to abduct Myrcella back to King 's Landing .
Jaime,Convincing Jaime that he did n't kill Joffrey , Tyrion notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy Cersei .
Jaime,Cryptically ( perhaps spurred by Doran ) , she then says that she knows `` your daughter '' Myrcella had no part in what befell Oberyn , and maybe even Jaime is innocent of that ( and indeed he is , as Oberyn volunteered for the trial by combat ) .
Jaime,Displaying a somewhat more critical mind than her brothers , Myrcella is suspicious about Jaime 's `` diplomatic mission '' to bring her back to King 's Landing , to which Jaime only replies that there are `` complicated matters '' involved .
Jaime,Doran asks if Tommen indeed commands that his sister be returned to the capital , and Jaime politely says he does , to which Doran says he can not disobey his king - Myrcella will return to King 's Landing .
Jaime,During their sword training , Bronn implores Jaime to visit his brother Tyrion in the dungeon , saying that Tyrion named Jaime his champion in The Eyrie because he knew Jaime would ride day and night to fight for him .
Jaime,Ellaria notes how odd it is that she and Oberyn were looked down on for their sexuality in King 's Landing , and Jaime is scorned for his incestuous love for Cersei - to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement - though a hundred years ago , if his name were Targaryen , no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship .
Jaime,Ellaria then finds Jaime in a study writing a letter back to King 's Landing informing of his return .
Jaime,Elsewhere in the Red Keep , Jaime , Ser Meryn Trant and King Joffrey discuss security at the upcoming wedding .
Jaime,Exhausted , Jaime says he 's tired of fighting and just wants to have a truce ; Brienne says you need trust to have a truce , but he says he trusts her , so she sits back down .
Jaime,Finally having enough , Karstark did the next best thing , and killed Jaime 's kin who they held prisoner .
Jaime,For half a second , Jaime stares at his severed right hand in shock , before what just happened can register in his mind and then he begins to scream in horror .
Jaime,Furious , Eddard crosses swords with Jaime .
Jaime,Furious at Jaime 's disobedience and lack of ambition , Tywin rebuffs him .
Jaime,Grey Wind and Jaime .
Jaime,Half-delirious from the infection , Jaime refuses , and says he 'll kill Qyburn if he tries .
Jaime,He also questions Jaime 's ability to serve in the Kingsguard with one hand .
Jaime,He also tells them that Bran is expected to live and notes Cersei and Jaime 's guarded reactions .
Jaime,He blames Tywin for their losses in the war and the capture of Jaime .
Jaime,He correctly deduces that Jaime helped Tyrion escape his cell , telling Tyrion that they can discuss the matter back in Tywin 's chambers .
Jaime,He jokes about her relationship with Jaime and she says that he has always been funny .
Jaime,He orders Jaime to become the man he was meant to be , and to take thirty thousand men and besiege Riverrun , Catelyn 's childhood home and the seat of House Tully .
Jaime,He presents one to his son Jaime as a gift .
Jaime,He reads Jaime 's brief entry and sneers that someone must have forgotten to record all of his uncle 's great deeds .
Jaime,He reminds her of the oath she swore to Jaime to find the Stark girls , but she states that Arya did not want her protection .
Jaime,He tells her that he knows the secret that Jon Arryn died for : that Cersei 's three children are not Robert 's , but the product of incest between her and Jaime .
Jaime,He wants Jaime to be his heir and return home to Casterly Rock , but Jaime insists on remaining in the Kingsguard .
Jaime,Her criticism and strength convinces Jaime to start eating .
Jaime,His direwolf Grey Wind is almost fully grown and menaces Jaime during the questioning .
Jaime,However , Jaime 's mobility is reduced because his hands are still manacled , and he is malnourished after having spent the past full year chained up in a cell .
Jaime,However , Jaime gradually starts to grow worried as Ned 's high level of skill becomes apparent .
Jaime,However he says that is precisely what he will do , as wine is poured for Jaime , and he raises his own goblet and offers a toast to King Tommen , First of His Name , long may he reign .
Jaime,In King 's Landing , Jaime advises Tommen .
Jaime,In a surge of effort Jaime manages to steal the sword from one of Locke 's men , but Jaime is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand , much less wield a sword - and he can not fight as well with his left hand as he could his sword-hand .
Jaime,In desperation , Jaime leaps into the pit to help her ; before the bear can harm either of them , Steelshanks shoots it with a crossbow , distracting the beast long enough for Jaime and Brienne to be pulled out of the pit .
Jaime,In his cell , Tyrion and Jaime discuss Tyrion 's fate and the irony of Lord Tywin striking down both his heirs if Jaime were to die being Tyrion 's champion ; Jaime declines to be Tyrion 's champion as he can not fight well enough with his left hand .
Jaime,In so doing she reveals her prowess as a fighter to Jaime .
Jaime,In the chambers of the Kingsguard , Jaime tasks Brienne with finding Sansa .
Jaime,In the dungeon , Jaime has Tyrion shackled and brought into the throne room to begin his trial .
Jaime,In the last hours before his trial by combat , Tyrion and Jaime share a final drink in Tyrion 's cell and reminisce about Orson Lannister , their simple-minded cousin who spent his days smashing beetles with a rock .
Jaime,In the middle of the night , Tyrion is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell door being opened by Jaime , who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for Tyrion with the assistance of Varys , who has secured a galley in the harbor on which Tyrion can sneak out of the city and flee to the Free Cities .
Jaime,In the sept , Jaime and Tommen talk about Myrcella and Prince Trystane .
Jaime,Jaime Lannister is escorted into the main apartments of the Water Gardens by Areo Hotah , to be received by Prince Doran Martell in a luxurious solar , along with Ellaria Sand , Doran 's son Trystane Martell , and Jaime 's `` niece '' Myrcella Baratheon .
Jaime,Jaime again begged Aerys to surrender , but the Mad King ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin 's head , and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze , burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire .
Jaime,Jaime and Bolton discuss Jaime 's release .
Jaime,Jaime angrily rants that the `` honorable '' Lord Stark would never have believed a word he said : Stark did n't want to hear Jaime 's side of the story when he 'd already judged him guilty .
Jaime,Jaime asks if Doran intends to behead him , but ( acting more sympathetic now that Jaime revealed he was threatened first ) he says that he will not , because he wishes to avoid war .
Jaime,Jaime asks if they want to negotiate , but Locke says they 'll have his head if he does n't bring the Kingslayer back to the King in the North , so there 's not much Jaime can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner .
Jaime,Jaime ca n't fight very well left-handed so Bronn kills one sentry 's horse in order for Jaime to fight him on foot .
Jaime,Jaime curtly says that Varys did ( when in fact , Jaime forced Varys to help him free Tyrion ) .
Jaime,Jaime is clearly irked by Joffrey 's arrogance as well as Meryn 's sycophantic agreement with the king 's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed ( Jaime notes that this is more the doing of the Tyrells ) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war .
Jaime,Jaime is disgusted by this revelation , but Qyburn counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions Jaime on how many he has killed compared to how many he 's saved .
Jaime,Jaime politely insists that Bronn was only following orders and they ca n't punish him for simply following Jaime 's commands .
Jaime,Jaime says he 's willing to try this , but Qyburn cautions that it will cause a great amount of pain so he needs to give him Milk of the Poppy , but Jaime refuses to take it , and says he 'll just scream .
Jaime,Jaime says that if she keeps hitting him , she can kill him and that he does n't fear death , though Jaime probably realizes that the Starks wo n't kill him as long as his sister holds Sansa and Arya hostage .
Jaime,Jaime then gladly informs Bronn that the Martells agreed to let Bronn go with Jaime , but on one condition : wordlessly , Areo then delivers it by striking Bronn in the face with his elbow , the large guard captain hitting him so hard that he is knocked to the floor .
Jaime,Jaime tries to smooth-talk Locke once again with offers of how his father Tywin will make him extravagantly rich if he lets Jaime go .
Jaime,Joffrey petulantly refuses to send his men after her , oblivious to her importance as a hostage or the fact that if any harm comes to her , the Starks may retaliate by executing his uncle Jaime .
Jaime,Jory engages Jaime but is quickly killed when Jaime stabs him through the eye with a dagger .
Jaime,Jory tries to leave Eddard 's message with Jaime , but is rebuffed , as Jaime angrily states that he does not serve Lord Stark .
Jaime,Later , Jaime visits Cersei , who is disgusted that , in her view , Jaime is taking Tyrion 's side because of his long-held affection for their brother .
Jaime,Later , Jaime waits in a courtyard by the sea for his training partner that Tyrion has arranged .
Jaime,Later , Qyburn peels away the crude tourniquet that Locke 's men applied to Jaime , and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected .
Jaime,Later , in the Red Keep , Cersei asks Jaime when was the first time he saw a dead body , to which Jaime replies their mother 's .
Jaime,Later on , Robb and his lords are debating on the route of their march , and on whether to march directly against Tywin 's army or against Jaime 's army besieging Riverrun .
Jaime,Later that night Jaime and Brienne are restrained near a campfire .
Jaime,Locke , who has been left in charge of the castle in Bolton 's absence , ca n't resist poking fun at the departing Jaime and sneers that he will 'take good care ' of Brienne , though Jaime does n't rise to the bait .
Jaime,Locke has been tormenting Jaime by not giving him water and he is almost dying of thirst .
Jaime,Locke is gaining maximum enjoyment from torturing someone who ca n't possibly fight back : he ties Jaime 's severed right hand onto a rope and hangs it around Jaime 's neck , forcing Jaime to smell as the flesh of his own hand rots .
Jaime,Locke is quite proud of himself for his torture of Jaime , but Roose is surprised that Jaime has lost his hand .
Jaime,Locke says that Jaime 's father ca n't help him now , and `` this should help you remember ! ''
Jaime,Locke taunting Jaime about his hand .
Jaime,Locke then points out that he filled the container with horse piss just to torment Jaime , who spits out what he can .
Jaime,Locke tries to stop them from leaving , but Jaime angrily tells him that Lord Bolton cares more about getting him back to King 's Landing alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy , and backed up by Steelshanks and his men , Locke is unable to stop them .
Jaime,Lord Rickard demands Jaime 's execution in revenge , regardless of his protected status as both a prisoner of war and a valuable political hostage .
Jaime,Lord Roose Bolton , who is also about to depart Harrenhal for the Twins , under orders from Robb Stark , requests that Jaime pass on his regards to Tywin ; Jaime asks that Bolton do the same for him with Robb .
Jaime,My name is Jaime ... ''
Jaime,Oblivious , Locke boasts that Jaime has n't `` lost '' the hand , and points out that he cut it off and hung Jaime 's own hand around his neck .
Jaime,Once inside the Sept , she chastises her brother Jaime for freeing their brother Tyrion and indirectly causing their father 's death .
Jaime,One of Locke 's men moves to give him water but instead empties the canteen over Jaime 's head to taunt him .
Jaime,Over a meal , Jaime and Tyrion discuss Jaime 's gilded steel hand , and he discloses to Tyrion that he can no longer fight , as all of his instincts are wrong using his left hand .
Jaime,Prince Doran has Areo Hotah bring Myrcella to Jaime in the quarters where he is confined , as Jaime is concerned for her safety .
Jaime,Privately , Cersei meets with Tyrion and expresses regret at having children with her own brother Jaime .
Jaime,Qyburn begins to dig into the stump of Jaime 's arm to cut out the gangrenous tissue , and Jaime howls in agony .
Jaime,Qyburn cautions him that it will cause a massive amount of pain , but Jaime says that he will just scream loudly .
Jaime,Qyburn gets ready to cut Jaime , and says he 'll at least try to save his elbow , but with a sudden burst of effort Jaime grabs him around the throat with his left hand , and says he does n't need his right hand to kill him .
Jaime,Qyburn relents , and says he could try cutting out the chunks of flesh which are outright rotten , then burning out the wounds with boiling wine , and with luck this might be able to stop the infection without having to amputate more of Jaime 's arm above the wrist .
Jaime,Realizing that Myrcella has come home , she joyfully runs down to the harbor , only to see a grim-faced Jaime alongside a shrouded body .
Jaime,Reluctantly , Tyrion explains that when he was very young , he and Jaime were out riding near Casterly Rock and found a young common girl in distress from bandits .
Jaime,Rickard explains that he was denied his vengeance when Robb 's mother Catelyn set Jaime free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in King 's Landing .
Jaime,Robb asserts his faith in his men and his concern at the lengths House Lannister would go to in order to free Jaime .
Jaime,Robb confronts Jaime with his direwolf .
Jaime,Robb receives the letter and interrogates the captive Jaime about his reasons for crippling Bran .
Jaime,Ser Jaime Lannister happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside , flaunting his dishonorable treatment of Jaime 's sister in his face .
Jaime,Shaken at the memory , Jaime speculates that King Aerys did n't believe he would die in the blaze ; in his lunacy , the Mad King believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the fire , granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes ... so Jaime finished Aerys off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died , concluding that Eddard Stark found him at that point .
Jaime,She also receives a letter informing her of Jaime 's capture .
Jaime,She asks Robb to consider exchanging Jaime for his sisters .
Jaime,She collapses in Jaime 's arms .
Jaime,She confesses her adultery with Ser Lancel , but denies her incestuous relationship with her brother Jaime .
Jaime,She exits , and Jaime is left to ponder what seems to be her apology .
Jaime,She insists it is a threat against Myrcella , a conclusion Jaime ca n't refute .
Jaime,She needles Petyr about his unrequited love for Catelyn and he counters by referencing her relationship with Jaime , telling her that knowledge is power .
Jaime,She rebukes his claim , saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice , and that she chooses Jaime .
Jaime,She refuses initially , but Jaime is aggressive .
Jaime,She wants to ensure that he is doing everything he can to find Jaime .
Jaime,She wonders if Joffrey 's violent personality is the price of her and Jaime 's sins .
Jaime,Stunned , Brienne asks why Jaime did n't defend himself with this account before .
Jaime,Suddenly Robb returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner , Jaime himself .
Jaime,Summoning Jaime Lannister , Robert jokingly questions him about Aerys Targaryen 's death , wondering if the Mad King died begging for mercy , but Jaime rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he 'd been saying since the siege of King 's Landing began : `` Burn them all '' .
Jaime,That night , Jaime kills Alton to lure the guard , Torrhen Karstark , into his cell .
Jaime,The Battle of the Whispering Wood has lifted the siege of Riverrun , and Jaime 's army has been destroyed .
Jaime,The Faith Militant grow increasingly aggressive ; Jaime and Bronn head south ; Ellaria and the Sand Snakes vow vengeance .
Jaime,The High Sparrow explains that if Jaime chooses to kill him then many of the sparrows will die fighting him , but it would n't really matter since they have no names or individual power .
Jaime,The Hound immediately accuses Brienne of working for the Lannisters , noticing her Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper , which Brienne admits was given to her by Jaime , frightening Arya into thinking that Brienne is working for the Lannisters .
Jaime,The Hound is judged by the gods ; Jaime is judged ; Jon proves himself ; Robb is betrayed ; Tyrion learns the cost of weddings .
Jaime,The following day , Locke 's men lead their prisoners Jaime and Brienne of Tarth back to Harrenhal on horseback .
Jaime,The next day , Jaime leaves Harrenhal in the company of Qyburn ( who is to accompany Jaime to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his Maester 's chain restored through Lord Tywin 's influence- Jaime jokes that his father will make Qyburn Grand Maester if he grows Jaime a new hand ) and a number of Bolton soldiers under the command of Steelshanks , one of Lord Bolton's captains .
Jaime,The short joyful moments for Tyrion and Jaime are shattered , as Tywin stands and proclaims the will of the gods is clear : Tyrion is guilty and sentenced to death .
Jaime,The strain of recounting his harrowing tale overcomes Jaime , however , and he begins to faint , nearly falling face-first into the water .
Jaime,They discuss about Jaime 's possible return to King 's Landing , with Cersei wondering where he could possibly be .
Jaime,They make their way to the Red Keep , where Jaime immediately calls on Cersei , who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing hand .
Jaime,They sail past Tarth , off the coast of the Stormlands , which Jaime mistakenly identifies as Estermont .
Jaime,They trade barbs about Cersei 's age , Cersei 's capability to have more children , and accusations of incest with Jaime , as well as Loras 's well-known homosexuality .
Jaime,They were only sent to capture Jaime , therefore Brienne means nothing to them , so at the slightest provocation they will kill her without hesitation .
Jaime,This comes as a shock , because his older brother Jaime gave up all right to inherit his father 's lands when he joined the Kingsguard , and Tyrion is rightfully the next in line of succession .
Jaime,Though the man initially refuses , Jaime uses the promise of a reward and the threat of Tywin Lannister 's retribution to convince him to go back .
Jaime,Tied up back to back on one of the horses , Jaime warns Brienne that when they make camp for the night , they will rape her , more than once , and that his honest advice is to give no resistance , and just think of Renly .
Jaime,Tiring of Jaime 's frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the Lannister side , Locke decides to prove that Jaime 's father will never deal with the likes of him .
Jaime,To get to Jaime , they need to cross the Green Fork of the River Trident , and the only crossing is at the Twins , held by the notoriously prickly and easily-offended Lord Walder Frey .
Jaime,Tommen believes that Cersei is to blame for Prince Trystane 's death but tells Jaime that he is n't upset with her .
Jaime,Tyrion asks Jaime if he thinks Oberyn stands a chance , but Jaime is not optimistic .
Jaime,Tyrion can not even reply , shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at Oberyn 's skull-crushed corpse , as does Jaime ; the only different reaction is from Cersei , who stares at Oberyn 's slaughtered body , listening to Tyrion 's death sentence while smirking in vindication .
Jaime,Tyrion gains new responsibilities ; Jon is taken to the Fist of the First Men ; Daenerys meets with the slavers ; Jaime strikes a deal with his captors .
Jaime,Tyrion is deeply distrustful of the offer , remarking that Eddard Stark was promised the same thing and yet still lost his head , but Jaime pleads with his brother to trust him , insisting that their father will keep his word .
Jaime,Tyrion names his own champion : his brother Jaime , considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm .
Jaime,Tyrion previously noted that he is next in line of succession after Jaime , as a younger son inherits before an older daughter , but Tywin said he would never let his hated dwarf son be his heir .
Jaime,Tyrion tells Jaime of how he used to observe Orson day after day in an attempt to understand his motives , but in the end he was never able to come to reach any understanding .
Jaime,Tyrion then asks to speak with Jaime .
Jaime,Tyrion then requests Jaime to bring him Bronn , hoping the sellsword will stand for him just as he did at the Eyrie .
Jaime,Tywin Lannister prepares his forces for battle and gives Jaime an important assignment .
Jaime,Tywin accepts , telling Jaime that Tyrion will be allowed to join the Night 's Watch after being found guilty of Joffrey 's murder , provided he pleads for mercy .
Jaime,Tywin discusses the future of House Lannister with his son Jaime .
Jaime,Tywin forced Jaime to reveal the truth : the girl was a prostitute and Jaime set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother .
Jaime,Tywin is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin Cersei reveals that all of the rumors about her and Jaime ( and their children ) are true - she will tell everyone and destroy Tywin 's vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and Tommen 's death .
Jaime,Tywin is upset with the three advisors , noting that between them , they possess the greatest number of spies in the world , yet none of them can locate his son Jaime , even though the entire Northern army has heard of his escape .
Jaime,Tywin makes it clear that he considers Jaime his heir - despite the fact that as a Kingsguard member , Jaime has officially renounced all rights to inheritance .
Jaime,Unknown to everyone in King 's Landing , Jaime Lannister , Brienne of Tarth , and Qyburn finally arrive ; the city folk do not even recognize Jaime after his long absence from the capital .
Jaime,Upon arriving at Harrenhal , Jaime is shocked and furious to find Locke and his cronies have thrown Brienne into a bear pit , facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself , as they all mockingly sing The Bear and the Maiden Fair .
Jaime,When Bran replies `` ten , '' Jaime remarks with a sigh , `` The things I do for love . ''
Jaime,When Cersei protests she is Queen Regent and not a brood mare , Tywin angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told : she will marry Loras and in so doing , put an end to what Tywin calls `` the disgusting rumors '' Stannis has been spreading about her and Jaime .
Jaime,When Jaime asks if there is news from the capital , Bolton informs him that Stannis Baratheon laid siege to the city in the Battle of the Blackwater ... then needlessly drags out revealing the result .
Jaime,When Jaime reminds her that she killed Stark men , Brienne responds that she does not serve House Stark , but Catelyn Stark .
Jaime,When Qyburn mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing Brienne before they die in battle or winter , Jaime , feeling guilty because his lie to protect Brienne has invertantly placed her in greater danger , urges Steelshanks to return to Harrenhal .
Jaime,When their party makes camp , as Qyburn checks Jaime 's stump , Jaime questions how the former Maester lost his chain .
Jaime,When they awake the next morning Bronn kills a snake that was near Jaime 's head and roasts it up for breakfast .
Jaime,While Jaime chased the bandits off , Tyrion comforted the girl , whose name was Tysha .
Jaime 's Dornish,Jaime tries to convince Myrcella to come with him , but Trystane interferes , suspicious of the bloodstains on Bronn and Jaime 's Dornish robes .
Jaime Lannister,Afterwards , Robert restores Eddard to his position as King 's Hand , and tells him not to quit again , or he will give the position to Jaime Lannister .
Jaime Lannister,Armed with this new information , Cersei barges into a Small Council meeting between Kevan Lannister , Olenna Tyrell , and Jaime Lannister .
Jaime Lannister,As Sansa wanders around the castle , coming to the tower where Jaime Lannister pushed her brother Brandon out of the window , she runs into Myranda .
Jaime Lannister,At Harrenhal , Locke presents the captive Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to the Northern castellan , Lord Roose Bolton .
Jaime Lannister,Barristan explains that a man of honor must keep his vows no matter what , whether he 's serving a drunk or a lunatic ( the reason why he never turned on King Aerys the way Jaime Lannister ultimately did ) .
Jaime Lannister,Before that he encounters Jaime Lannister in the throne room .
Jaime Lannister,Blithely waving away her son 's torment of Sansa and homicidal outbursts she says that her brother Jaime Lannister stayed by her side the whole time she was giving birth to Joffrey , but Sansa should never expect such devotion from Joffrey .
Jaime Lannister,Brienne tells Arya of her sacred vow to protect her mother , although she failed to do so because she was sent by her mother to return Jaime Lannister .
Jaime Lannister,Catelyn visits the captive Jaime Lannister who taunts her about Ned 's death and offers to serve her as a lover .
Jaime Lannister,Discouraged , he moves on to present Tyrion 's offer that the Lannisters want to make a prisoner exchange with the Starks : if they release Jaime Lannister , Queen Cersei will release both Sansa Stark and Arya Stark ( Baelish lies about the Lannisters having Arya ) .
Jaime Lannister,Finally , Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth are slowly making their way across country through the Riverlands , heading to King 's Landing intending to make the prisoner exchange for the Stark girls ( really , just Sansa ) .
Jaime Lannister,He details the incestuous relationship between Cersei and Jaime Lannister and challenges Joffrey 's legitimacy .
Jaime Lannister,He suggests that Cersei 's uncle Kevan Lannister muster a force or have Jaime Lannister lead an army to the North .
Jaime Lannister,In the Riverlands , Jaime Lannister has had his sword-hand cut off by Locke .
Jaime Lannister,Lord Eddard Stark wakes up after a long period of unconsciousness , due to the injuries inflicted on him by Jaime Lannister 's men .
Jaime Lannister,Robb is unsurprised that she rejected them and imprisons Alton with his cousin Jaime Lannister .
Jaime Lannister,Robb points out that these boys had nothing to do with the death of Karstark 's sons , who were both killed by Jaime Lannister .
Jaime Lannister,Roose Bolton decides what to do with Jaime Lannister .
Jaime Lannister,Selmy 's disgrace is only compounded when he learns his post as Lord Commander is to be given to Jaime Lannister , much to his disgust .
Jaime Lannister,Ser Jaime Lannister happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside , flaunting his dishonorable treatment of Jaime 's sister in his face .
Jaime Lannister,Shortly afterwards , Cersei , Jaime Lannister and the reanimated Ser Gregor Clegane enter .
Jaime Lannister,Somewhere else in the Riverlands , Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth have been taken captive by Locke and a detachment of men from House Bolton .
Jaime Lannister,Summoning Jaime Lannister , Robert jokingly questions him about Aerys Targaryen 's death , wondering if the Mad King died begging for mercy , but Jaime rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he 'd been saying since the siege of King 's Landing began : `` Burn them all '' .
Jaime Lannister,The Pentoshi ship captain found her in Planky Town , and as Bronn feared , he indeed tried to sell her information about Jaime Lannister 's arrival in Dorne .
Jaime Lannister,They realize that they are now in a race against time to see who can take Myrcella from Doran first : Jaime Lannister or themselves .
Jaime Lannister,Traveling east to King 's Landing , Brienne of Tarth and Jaime Lannister come upon the bodies of three women , hanged by Stark soldiers for having slept with Lannister soldiers .
Jaime Lannister,Unknown to everyone in King 's Landing , Jaime Lannister , Brienne of Tarth , and Qyburn finally arrive ; the city folk do not even recognize Jaime after his long absence from the capital .
Jamie,Myrcella then reveals that she knows that Jamie is her real father , and that she is glad that he is , and the two embrace .
Janos,From across the courtyard , Stannis Baratheon sees Jon behead Janos for refusing his orders , and slightly nods in approval .
Janos,Grenn steps in by falsely claiming that Alliser needs Janos back down below .
Janos,Having publicly disobeyed and insulted Jon , the Lord Commander orders Janos taken outside , and calls for Olly to fetch him his sword .
Janos Slynt,Finally , Lord Commander Snow assigns Janos Slynt with the task of restoring and manning the abandoned castle Greyguard .
Janos Slynt,He tells Littlefinger that money will have to be found to strengthen the city guards , as well as giving twenty of his own men to Janos Slynt 's command , until the tournament is over .
Janos Slynt,It turns out that Sam had been sent to retrieve Jon , who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers , including Maester Aemon , acting Lord Commander Alliser Thorne , First Builder Othell Yarwyck , and the exiled former Lord Commander of the King 's Landing City Watch , Janos Slynt .

Janos Slynt,On top of the Wall , Janos Slynt , having no true leadership experience , breaks down at the sight of the massive wildling army and begins fumbling his orders .

Janos Slynt,Sam returns to Gilly just like he promised and discovers Janos Slynt , who hid in fear during the entire battle .
Janos Slynt,The streets of the capital city are overflowing with starving refugees from the War of the Five Kings , as Cersei ignored both Tyrion and Janos Slynt 's earlier warnings that something had to be done to care for the starving peasants or there would be mounting discontent with her son 's rule .
Jaqen,After confirming that Arya has mastered blind sparring , Jaqen approaches Arya and offers to give back her sight if she tells him her name .
Jaqen,Arya , Hot Pie , and Gendry walk through the gates at midnight , as Jaqen instructed .
Jaqen,Arya asks who the person on the floor with Jaqen 's face is .
Jaqen,Arya gives Jaqen his own name
Jaqen,Arya later shares with Jaqen her plan to poison Lady Crane 's rum , which no one else in the troupe drinks .
Jaqen,Arya notices Jaqen on the walkway above and he holds a single finger to his face to signify his responsibility .
Jaqen,Arya states that he was her friend , and hears Jaqen 's voice behind her say 'he was no one ' .
Jaqen,Back at the House , Jaqen allows Arya to progress to an inner chamber where she is to assist the Waif in stripping and washing corpses .
Jaqen,Brienne silences Jaime ; Arya receives a gift from Jaqen ; Dany goes to a strange place ; Jon proves himself to Qhorin .
Jaqen,Handing Arya a vial , Jaqen tells her an actress , Lady Crane , will be the next to receive the Many-Faced God 's `` gift . ''
Jaqen,His face morphs into that of the man Arya knew as Jaqen .
Jaqen,However , Jaqen is able to tell when Arya is lying and hits her with a switch whenever she does .
Jaqen,Meanwhile , Jaqen has her mixing potions blindly .
Jaqen,She departs , and while Jaqen seems to suspect that she was lying , he makes no outward reaction to it .
Jaqen,She does so now , and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it , but she says only `` Valar morghulis '' ( as Jaqen instructed ) , to which the captain gives the traditional response , `` Valar dohaeris . ''
Jaqen,She is drawn to the caged prisoners ( Jaqen H'ghar , Rorge and Biter ) when Jaqen asks her for water and introduces himself .
Jaqen,She turns around to see that the Waif now has Jaqen 's face .
Jaqen,The Waif grabs Arya as Jaqen pulls out a vial , presumably containing some kind of poison .
Jaqen,Theon holds the fort ; Arya calls in her debt with Jaqen ; Robb is betrayed ; Stannis and Davos approach their destination .
Jaqen,When Jaqen asks Arya who she is , she replies that she is no one .
Jaqen H'ghar,A blind Arya Stark resumes her training with the Waif and Jaqen H'ghar , the former of whom beats her repeatedly when she lies .
Jaqen H'ghar,Arya assumes the identity of Lanna , a clam-seller , and shows Jaqen H'ghar she can convincingly become a different person , developing an elaborate and very believable backstory .
Jaqen H'ghar,Arya lingers outside waiting for admittance , but is rejected by an elder man despite showing the coin Jaqen H'ghar had given her and mentioning their prior association .
Jaqen H'ghar,Arya receives a promise from the enigmatic Jaqen H'ghar .
Jaqen H'ghar,Arya remembers the special coin that the Faceless Man known as Jaqen H'ghar gave her , and instructed her to present to any man from Braavos if she needed aid .
Jaqen H'ghar,Arya runs to find Jaqen H'ghar , telling him that Amory Lorch is the second name he owes her .
Jaqen H'ghar,During the fight Arya rescues Jaqen H'ghar from a fire near the prisoner wagon .
Jaqen H'ghar,However , Jaqen H'ghar and the Waif appear and say that Meryn 's life was not hers to take , and that a debt must be paid .
Jaqen H'ghar,Later , when Arya is asleep , Jaqen H'ghar comes to test Arya again .
Jaqen H'ghar,Off-screen , Arya explained to the boys how Jaqen H'ghar helped them escape because he offered that he would kill any three people she named .
Jaqen H'ghar,Realizing that she has missed her chance to kill Tywin , Arya pressures the assassin Jaqen H'ghar into aiding her escape from Harrenhal .
Jaqen H'ghar,She is drawn to the caged prisoners ( Jaqen H'ghar , Rorge and Biter ) when Jaqen asks her for water and introduces himself .
Jaqen H'ghar,She leaves to fetch water and encounters Jaqen H'ghar , now a Lannister man-at-arms .
Jaqen H'ghar,She offers the coin given to her by Jaqen H'ghar as payment .
Jaqen H'ghar,She tries to fight back , but the Waif vanishes , replaced with Jaqen H'ghar .
Jaqen H'ghar,She watches as Jaqen H'ghar assists a supplicant in drinking from the temple 's well .
Jaqen H'ghar,Stating that `` a man is not Jaqen H'ghar , '' he responds to Arya 's question as to who he really is with the answer `` No one .
Jaqen H'ghar,The water gives the peace of death to the sickly girl , and Arya , having successfully proven that she can lie , is brought to the Hall of Faces with Jaqen H'ghar , a great underground chamber that houses thousands of faces .
Jaqen H'ghar,Traveling away from Harrenhal , Arya , Gendry and Hot Pie cross paths with Jaqen H'ghar , who has been waiting for them .
Jaqen H'ghar,Tywin is convinced that it was an assassination attempt on himself , unaware that Jaqen H'ghar actually killed Lorch on the request of Arya Stark .
Jaqen H'ghar,When Jaqen H'ghar asks what happened , she lies to him and says that the Thin Man simply was n't hungry today and did n't order any of her oysters .
Jeor,Craster tells Jeor that he has not seen the missing Benjen Stark and reports that the other wildlings are assembling for the King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder .
Jeor,Jon realizes that Jeor has known all along that Craster is sacrificing his sons .
Jeor,Jorah asks how he died : Tyrion says he only knows the report he heard , which said that his father led an expedition beyond the Wall , but there was a mutiny , and Jeor was murdered by his own men .
Jeor,Qhorin arrives and warns Jeor that they must change their tactics to combat the wildling army under King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder .
Jeor,Watching over the new recruits with Lord Commander Jeor Mormont , Tyrion notes Thorne 's stern and unusual ways , but Jeor does n't care as he only requires Thorne to turn the `` thieves and runaways '' into men of the Night 's Watch .
Jeor Mormont,Before Jon leaves , he remembers the promise he made to Jeor Mormont and decides to leave Longclaw with Sam .
Jeor Mormont,Jorah asks how he could have known his father Jeor Mormont , but Tyrion explains he visited the Wall once and met him : he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men , a rare thing in the world , but now as the eulogy for Night 's Watch members goes , `` the world will not see his like again . ''
Jeor Mormont,Karl drinks wine from the skull of Jeor Mormont , drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in King 's Landing before ordering Rast to `` feed the beast . ''
Jeor Mormont,Later , Tyrion discusses north of the Wall with Jeor Mormont and his chief adviser , the ancient and blind Maester Aemon .
Jeor Mormont,Sam defends himself by reciting the Night 's Watch oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the Wall they are on and repeating Jeor Mormont 's assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians .
Jhiqui,Dany 's Dothraki handmaidens Irri and Jhiqui dismiss the story , saying that the moon is a goddess , wife to the sun .
Joanna,When Tyrion asks why his father is doing this , Tywin is shocked as if Tyrion insulted him , and says it should be obvious as Tyrion `` killed '' his mother Joanna in childbirth so that he might enter the world .
Joffrey,A deeply embarrassed Cersei forces a smile and insists to the rest of the council that Joffrey was only joking and did not mean it .
Joffrey,A disconcerted Joffrey changes the subject to Daenerys Targaryen ; Tywin is surprised that Joffrey even knows about the exiled princess .
Joffrey,A member of the Kingsguard then presents a Valyrian steel sword and Tywin tells him that it is one of two swords of its kind in the capital , and Joffrey rushes to wield it .
Joffrey,A who 's who of honored guests turns out for Joffrey and Margaery 's wedding in King 's Landing .
Joffrey,After a tense moment , Tywin defuses the situation by agreeing that there will be no bedding ceremony , and placates Joffrey by claiming Tyrion 's outburst is merely the result of his being extremely drunk .
Joffrey,After enough times of Olenna insisting that she can trust her not to repeat what she says , Sansa blurts out that Joffrey is `` a monster '' .
Joffrey,Against Cersei 's ineffectual protests , Joffrey gets up and , flanked by his Kingsguard , taunts Sansa that she 's still found a way to marry a Lannister .
Joffrey,Arya and Sansa are still at odds over the incident with Joffrey and her direwolf .
Joffrey,Arya has a surprise visitor ; Dany vows to take what is hers ; Joffrey meets his subjects ; Qhorin gives Jon a chance to prove himself .
Joffrey,As Sansa is leaving the godswood , she is approached by Dontos Hollard , who thanks her for convincing Joffrey to spare his life and gives her what he claims to be his mother 's necklace as a token of gratitude .
Joffrey,As the court stands in shocked silence , Joffrey seethes with outrage and Tyrion defiantly glares at his nephew with pure hatred .
Joffrey,As the royal party travels back to the Red Keep through the crowded streets , the starving refugees and commoners of King 's Landing plead for bread and hurl insults at King Joffrey , and ultimately , someone throws cow excrement into Joffrey 's face .
Joffrey,At crossbow-point , Joffrey forces Ros to beat Daisy unconscious , and then to dump her body in Tyrion 's chambers , to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of Sansa again .
Joffrey,At first , Joffrey sadistically menaces Sansa by brandishing a crossbow at her and openly toying with the thought of killing her right in front of the throne to send her brother a message .
Joffrey,At the breakfast celebration , Mace Tyrell gifts Joffrey a magnificent golden chalice with seven facets , one for each of the major houses in the Seven Kingdoms and wishes he and his daughter , Margaery Tyrell , a long and happy marriage .
Joffrey,At the same time , Joffrey is himself drinking too much wine , and losing what few inhibitions he has , his behavior becomes increasingly offensive to both Sansa and Tyrion .
Joffrey,Baelish is again impressed , and confirms that Joffrey was simply too volatile ; a king like him as an ally was more a hindrance than a benefit .
Joffrey,Before taking his leave Tywin smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten Joffrey squirming on the Iron Throne .
Joffrey,Blithely waving away her son 's torment of Sansa and homicidal outbursts she says that her brother Jaime Lannister stayed by her side the whole time she was giving birth to Joffrey , but Sansa should never expect such devotion from Joffrey .
Joffrey,Bronn suggests to Tyrion that as an angry young man , maybe what Joffrey needs is to have sex with a woman , and that they should set him up with a prostitute .
Joffrey,But despite being filled with dozens of knights and officials , no one intervenes out of fear of Joffrey 's wrath .
Joffrey,Cersei and her son Joffrey .
Joffrey,Cersei firmly believes that Sansa and Joffrey not being in love is a good thing ; she advises Sansa `` the more people you love , the weaker you are . ''
Joffrey,Cersei presents Sansa with warped advice on Joffrey , bizarre counseling based on her bitter marriage with King Robert Baratheon .
Joffrey,Cersei realizes she has lost control of Joffrey to the Tyrells .
Joffrey,Cersei says that no one expects her to love Joffrey , though she may take comfort in her love for the children they will have .
Joffrey,Cersei tells him his life is not in danger from Joffrey , as he dare not try anything like that now that Tywin is the Hand .
Joffrey,Convincing Jaime that he did n't kill Joffrey , Tyrion notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy Cersei .
Joffrey,Denouncing his nephew as a `` halfwit , '' Tyrion points out the absurdity of punishing Sansa for her brother 's actions miles away in a war that Joffrey himself started .
Joffrey,Despite being accompanied by only a few dozen guards facing hundreds of peasants , Joffrey impetuously orders his soldiers to kill the entire crowd .
Joffrey,Despite being clearly terrified , Sansa refuses to give Joffrey the satisfaction of scaring her and continues to firmly pledge her loyalty .
Joffrey,Dismissive of the threat posed by Stannis following the Battle of the Blackwater , Joffrey leafs through the Book of Brothers , which details the history of the Kingsguard and those who served in it .
Joffrey,Easily played , Joffrey offers to take her with him to share in the excitement of killing something .
Joffrey,Eddard does not write Joffrey 's name , instead saying `` the rightful heir '' .
Joffrey,Eddard explains that Sansa was put in a difficult position by the king and queen , and while she should n't have lied , winning the long-term approval of Joffrey , her future husband , was important .
Joffrey,Eddard finds Robert telling Joffrey that he wishes he could have been a better father to him .
Joffrey,Eddard responds that Joffrey has no claim to the Iron Throne and commands Slynt to take the Queen and her son into custody .
Joffrey,Enraged and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his wedding guests , Joffrey petulantly pours wine over Tyrion 's head and orders him to serve him wine as his cupbearer .
Joffrey,Falling to his knees , Ser Barristan explains that following Robert 's death and his dismissal by Joffrey , he has been searching for Daenerys Stormborn , to beg her forgiveness and offer his service , hoping to make amends for failing House Targaryen during and after Robert 's Rebellion , when he served in her father 's Kingsguard .
Joffrey,From the battlements , Joffrey berates Tyrion , demanding to know why his ships are not meeting Stannis 's fleet .
Joffrey,Furious , Joffrey proclaims that he was punishing her .
Joffrey,Given that Joffrey openly promised to rape Sansa to `` put a son in you '' as soon as she had her blood , she then frantically tries to get rid of the bloody sheets to remove the evidence .
Joffrey,Grand Maester Pycelle extols the virtues of mercy and Joffrey agrees that he could be merciful and send Eddard to the Night 's Watch as his mother has suggested and as Sansa has begged .
Joffrey,He also notes that the Tyrells wo n't go through with their plan until after Joffrey 's wedding , which means they need to act first ... namely by finding Sansa another husband .
Joffrey,He also states that he 's not Joffrey , Tyrion would rather bide his time and humiliate them .
Joffrey,He asks her whether she wants to end her engagement to the king , but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves Joffrey and will uphold her duty .
Joffrey,He boasts to Ros of the several great kings he has served , lamenting first how Aerys Targaryen devolved from a charming young man into a paranoid lunatic obsessed with fire , how Robert Baratheon was a great soldier , but perhaps not so ideal a king , before displaying his sycophantic loyalty to Joffrey .
Joffrey,He concludes that Joffrey ordered the massacre , having initially suspected that it was Cersei .
Joffrey,He criticizes his sister for failing to rein in Joffrey and overseeing numerous bad decisions , particularly the execution of Ned Stark .
Joffrey,He decides to let Ned discipline Arya while he will do the same to Joffrey , but Cersei demands that the direwolf be executed .
Joffrey,He details the incestuous relationship between Cersei and Jaime Lannister and challenges Joffrey 's legitimacy .
Joffrey,He is to bring Cersei and Joffrey to heel and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes .
Joffrey,He names his wife , Sansa , but Pod informs him that she disappeared moments after Joffrey 's death .
Joffrey,He opines that many people had a motive for killing Joffrey .
Joffrey,He says that Joffrey is the true King on the Iron Throne , pleasing him .
Joffrey,He sneers that she has allowed Joffrey to run roughshod over her , the city and its people , and that he intends to rein in his grandson 's deranged behavior .
Joffrey,He stares at the wall across the room and sees several weapons on display , among them Joffrey 's old crossbow , and his expression quickly darkens .
Joffrey,He then reveals his true feelings about Joffrey , denying guilt in the king 's murder but saying he wished to have killed Joffrey himself .
Joffrey,However , Joffrey barely tolerates his mother 's chiding and dismissively tells her off .
Joffrey,Impressed , Tyrion remarks that she has learned how to survive around Joffrey and might just make it out of her situation alive , respectfully calling her `` Lady Stark . ''
Joffrey,Impressed with her instincts , Baelish admits that Tyrion is in fact innocent , and reveals Sansa 's own part in Joffrey 's death - Ser Dontos ' necklace was in fact the murder weapon , and someone slipped a stone ( which was poisonous ) into Joffrey 's wine .
Joffrey,In her new headquarters atop the Great Pyramid , Daenerys learns that Joffrey is dead and Tommen has been crwoned .
Joffrey,In particular , Cersei is nervous about how skilled Margaery Tyrell is at manipulating Joffrey .
Joffrey,In private , Sansa is overjoyed to be free , until Littlefinger points out that it will not stop Joffrey from tormenting her ; however , he does assure her that he will help her escape , for the sake of her mother .
Joffrey,Indeed , he might even be grateful for the gesture : given that he did n't have much of a father figure in Robert Baratheon to set him straight , doing something nice for the boy might even be the second chance Joffrey needs to re-establish a relationship with a male family figure .
Joffrey,Infuriated , Joffrey orders Ser Meryn Trant to beat her , as Cersei has told him that a king should not hit his queen .
Joffrey,It is n't clear if anyone in the room , including Tywin or Joffrey , think that Tyrion 's outburst was simply due to being very drunk , but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass .
Joffrey,It quickly becomes apparent that Joffrey is excited by violence and sadism , so she flirts with him by complimenting the crossbow and musing about killing something herself .
Joffrey,Jaime ( who had previously noted to his father that thousands in King 's Landing alone still want Joffrey dead ) points out that the war is far from won ; Stannis is still alive and will probably raise fresh armies .
Joffrey,Jaime and Cersei rush in and turn Joffrey over on his back .
Joffrey,Jaime is clearly irked by Joffrey 's arrogance as well as Meryn 's sycophantic agreement with the king 's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed ( Jaime notes that this is more the doing of the Tyrells ) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war .
Joffrey,Joffrey goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather , deriding Tywin as a coward who hid under Casterly Rock while Joffrey 's father King Robert won the real war when he overthrew the Targaryens .
Joffrey,Joffrey is puzzled at why Tywin does n't think they should do anything about her , but Tywin reminds Joffrey that the last Targaryen dragons were stunted inbred creatures who were n't a threat to anyone , and Daenerys ' dragons are probably just curiosities at best , not grand weapons of war .
Joffrey,Joffrey points an accusatory finger in Tyrion 's direction , as he examines the wine goblet ( though it is not made clear if Joffrey is accusing Tyrion or merely the wine ) .
Joffrey,Joffrey quickly becomes violent and threatens Arya at sword point , but before he can hurt her , Arya 's direwolf , Nymeria , attacks Joffrey , biting at his arm .
Joffrey,King Joffrey doles out rewards to his subjects .
Joffrey,King Joffrey rewards those who served him well in the battle .
Joffrey,Lady Olenna insists that Sansa tell her the truth about what Joffrey is like , as he is to marry Margaery .
Joffrey,Lancel returns to Cersei to warn that they are defeated unless Joffrey returns .
Joffrey,Littlefinger sits next to Sansa , and remarks that she and Joffrey have had a lover 's quarrel ( as Joffrey is still giving her the cold shoulder ) .
Joffrey,Littlefinger suggests that they keep quiet , acknowledge Joffrey as king and make him their puppet .
Joffrey,Littlefinger then arrives and talks to Eddard , who tells him the truth about Joffrey 's parentage .
Joffrey,Loras Tyrell asks that Joffrey wed his sister Margaery to unite their houses .
Joffrey,Loras points out that Joffrey is a monster , that Tommen is only eight and laughs at the notion of Robert and Renly 's other brother , Lord Stannis , ever becoming king , as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster .
Joffrey,Lord Petyr Baelish accompanies the Tyrell faction , sensing an opportunity to sway them to Joffrey 's side .
Joffrey,Margaery eventually manages to divert attention to the new custom crossbow Joffrey 's had made for his excursion .
Joffrey,Margaery finds a way to bond with Joffrey .
Joffrey,Margaery is summoned to Joffrey 's chambers to see if she needs anything before he leaves on a hunting trip .
Joffrey,Margaery replies that she will `` plant the seed '' of the idea after she and Joffrey are married .
Joffrey,Margaery shocks the guards and bewilders Joffrey by getting out and exploring , eventually arriving at an orphanage and interacting with the children .
Joffrey,Meanwhile , Joffrey 's ride back from the Great Sept of Baelor in a heavily guarded palanquin is interrupted when his betrothed , Lady Margaery Tyrell , stops the procession in Flea Bottom unexpectedly .
Joffrey,Meanwhile , Joffrey coldly contemplates Ros 's quarrel-ridden corpse .
Joffrey,More importantly , though , Joffrey 's death was something that his `` new friends '' wanted very much , and a gift is always helpful to help a new friendship `` grow strong . ''
Joffrey,Moreover , Tywin says that even if Daenerys ' dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago , they are on the far side of the world and no threat to Joffrey 's rule .
Joffrey,Mycah runs off , and Arya throws Joffrey 's sword in the river before running off herself .
Joffrey,Now completely enraged , Joffrey bellows that as king , he can do whatever he pleases , but Tyrion again coldly counters that the Mad King thought he could do as he pleased too , which led to him being overthrown and killed .
Joffrey,Olenna is disappointed , but unsurprised , given the rumors that have been circulating about Joffrey 's public outbursts .
Joffrey,Olenna reminds him of the role they both played in Joffrey 's murder , and that , should her House fall , she will have no reason to keep his involvement a secret .
Joffrey,On Dragonstone Isle , Stannis Baratheon learns of Joffrey 's death and warns Ser Davos that their time to lay claim to the Iron throne dwindles if no army can be secured to wage war again .
Joffrey,Out of a large golden lion , five dwarves ride out , representing Joffrey , Renly Baratheon , Stannis Baratheon , Robb Stark , and Balon Greyjoy , each of the five kings in the War of the Five Kings .
Joffrey,Prince Joffrey 's bodyguard , Sandor Clegane , known as `` the Hound , '' a man with half his face burned in a mysterious accident , introduces Sansa to Ser Ilyn Payne , the king 's headsman , a frightening-looking man who had his tongue torn out on the orders of the Mad King many years ago .
Joffrey,Prince Joffrey comes to apologize to Sansa for the incident on the Kingsroad .
Joffrey,Queen Cersei Lannister and Pycelle make a show of convincing Joffrey to set aside his betrothal to Sansa Stark , given the treachery of House Stark .
Joffrey,Robb does n't want the Iron Throne , just revenge on Joffrey for his father 's death .
Joffrey,Robert agrees , but offers a sweetener : the hand of his son , Joffrey , in marriage to Eddard 's daughter , Sansa .
Joffrey,Robert instructs Eddard to take a letter naming him as the Lord Protector of the Realm , to rule until Joffrey comes of age .
Joffrey,Sandor matter-of-factly admits that he killed Mycah , but says he was in no place to question then-Prince Joffrey 's orders .
Joffrey,Sansa Stark intercedes telling Joffrey that ordering a death on one 's name day is bad luck .
Joffrey,Sansa and Tyrion attempt to leave the feast , while Margaery serves Joffrey a piece of pie .
Joffrey,Sansa begs Joffrey for her father 's life , claiming that the medicine he was taking for his injured leg was responsible for his treasonous talk .
Joffrey,Sansa convinces Joffrey to instead make Dontos his court fool , for which Dontos is grateful .
Joffrey,Sansa hands the goblet to Tyrion , and he fills it with wine and hands it back to Joffrey .
Joffrey,Sansa is initially reluctant , but when Olenna mentions her father , Sansa breaks down and , her eyes blazing , angrily recounts how Joffrey had said he would show her father mercy , only to behead him in front of her , and how he then took her up to the wall and forced her to look at her father 's head on a spike and claim him providing her father with a swift death was `` mercy '' .
Joffrey,Sansa is skeptical Joffrey will let her go but Margaery is confident he will do it to please her , once she is his wife .
Joffrey,Sansa is unaware that the Queen put Joffrey up to the apology some time ago .
Joffrey,Sansa is worried that this means the Tyrells will cancel their proposed marriage alliance ( meaning Sansa will be stuck with Joffrey again ) , but Olenna assures her that her son Mace is too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything .
Joffrey,Sansa moves up behind Joffrey , apparently preparing to shove him off the walkway to his death , but unexpectedly Sandor Clegane dabs the blood off her lip with a handkerchief and after Joffrey leaves , tells her to give him what he wants .
Joffrey,Sansa practices lying for a change , and tells him that they should wait until after Joffrey 's wedding , primarily because she fears for his safety if the plan fails .
Joffrey,Sansa protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor , they are talking about breaking her betrothal to Joffrey .
Joffrey,Sansa quietly retorts that Robb might give her Joffrey 's instead .
Joffrey,Sansa refuses - she is going to marry Joffrey and have lots of golden-haired babies .
Joffrey,Sansa thinks the realm will hate her if she only has daughters , along with her belief Joffrey is still angry over the incident by the river and her anger at her father over Lady 's death .
Joffrey,Sansa tries to help Joffrey , but he spitefully tells her to leave him alone and go for help .
Joffrey,Sansa warns the Tyrells that Joffrey is a monster .
Joffrey,Selmy is confused , pointing out that Kingsguard serve for life , but Joffrey angrily says that Selmy is too old , and could n't protect his father .
Joffrey,She and Septa Mordane discuss the expectation that Sansa will have to provide Joffrey with an heir .
Joffrey,She is shocked to learn he does n't care which king takes the throne after they defeat Joffrey ( having declared for neither of the Baratheon brothers ) .
Joffrey,She points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused , he has n't hurt the ones who killed his father , Joffrey and Tywin Lannister .
Joffrey,She says Tywin should try stopping Joffrey from doing what he likes ( implying he will find it extremely difficult ) , but her father firmly responds , `` I will . ''
Joffrey,She testifies that Tyrion and Sansa planned Joffrey 's murder together , claiming that Sansa wanted vengeance for the murder of her father , mother , and brother .
Joffrey,She uses the rumors about Renly 's homosexuality to redirect Joffrey 's anger , stating that Renly always found excuses to avoid sex , but , in one instance , drunkenly suggested `` something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in children '' , which draws her new fiance 's sympathy .
Joffrey,She wonders if Joffrey 's violent personality is the price of her and Jaime 's sins .
Joffrey,So Tyrion arranges for two prostitutes from Littlefinger 's brothel , Ros and Daisy , to entertain Joffrey .
Joffrey,Stannis dictates a letter about Joffrey 's parentage .
Joffrey,Stannis says that he wants her , and that he wants Joffrey and Robb dead , and asks her to make `` a son '' again with him ( like the Shadow-creature she conjured to assassinate Renly ) .
Joffrey,Terrified of being brought to Joffrey , Sansa is instead brought before Queen Regent Cersei Lannister , who awkwardly tries to comfort her .
Joffrey,That evening , Joffrey and Cersei visit Margaery and her brother Loras Tyrell for a small dinner party .
Joffrey,The ceremony is a grim affair ; Joffrey smugly escorts Sansa to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which Tyrion was to stand on to cloak Sansa in Lannister colors as part of the ceremony , eliciting snickers from the congregation ( though the scowl of Lord Tywin quickly silences them ) .
Joffrey,The party enters the throne room , where Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne .
Joffrey,The royal party 's guards are soon overwhelmed , and Joffrey , Cersei and Tyrion barely make it back to the castle unscathed .
Joffrey,The thought of finally escaping Joffrey , being wed to her idol and becoming a Tyrell makes Sansa choke out tears of joy .
Joffrey,They manipulate Sansa into writing a letter to her brother Robb , asking him to bend the knee peacefully to Joffrey .
Joffrey,This puzzles Joffrey , who matter-of-factly states to his mother that he did mean it , and he will have Robb 's head served at his wedding feast .
Joffrey,Thus distracted , Margaery convinces Joffrey to greet the crowd outside .
Joffrey,Tyrion Lannister arrives back in King 's Landing , to Joffrey 's disdain , but to the delight of Tommen and Myrcella who had worried that he was dead .
Joffrey,Tyrion Lannister insists that his nephew Joffrey pay his respects to Lord and Lady Stark , since his absence has been noted .
Joffrey,Tyrion agrees that maybe this would give Joffrey a chance to release his frustrations away from Sansa .
Joffrey,Tyrion also passes a street protest that blames him for the ills of the city , as they believe Tyrion to be manipulating Joffrey .
Joffrey,Tyrion approaches Joffrey , who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table .
Joffrey,Tyrion attempts to restrain Joffrey 's cruelty .
Joffrey,Tyrion cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that Joffrey should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the Battle of the Blackwater , cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is `` clearly mad with lust '' and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night .
Joffrey,Tyrion finds Varys on his way to a breakfast celebration on the day of Joffrey 's wedding .
Joffrey,Tyrion flatly forbids it and tells Joffrey that Sansa is n't his to torment anymore .
Joffrey,Tyrion hands the goblet to Joffrey and he quickly drinks all of it .
Joffrey,Tyrion is enraged by Joffrey 's shocking stupidity , for massively overreacting to having cow dung thrown at him , and for not realizing that his orders would cause a riot among the starving peasants and endanger the entire royal party .
Joffrey,Tyrion is visibly startled by the news , already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause , but Joffrey brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve Robb 's severed head to Sansa at his wedding feast .
Joffrey,Tyrion overhears this and looks vexed , but proceeds to approach Joffrey and Podrick Payne , Tyrion 's squire , presents him with the Lives of Four Kings , a book detailing the reigns of four kings by Grand Maester Kaeth .
Joffrey,Tyrion realizes that it was in fact Joffrey who ordered Ser Mandon Moore to kill him , because Tyrion was the only one who stood up to him .
Joffrey,Tyrion then contemptuously slaps his nephew across the face but Joffrey does not retaliate .
Joffrey,Tyrion tries to protest , pointing out that Joffrey has made Sansa 's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force Tyrion on her after she has finally escaped Joffrey is cruel , even by Tywin 's standards .
Joffrey,Tyrion turns his wrath upon Joffrey , berating his actions as Sansa is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming ( and the fact that Joffrey does n't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp ) .
Joffrey,Tyrion wonders aloud what Joffrey would do if he found out that Lancel had not only killed Joffrey 's father but was also sleeping with his mother .
Joffrey,Tyrions threatens Joffrey .
Joffrey,Tywin accepts , telling Jaime that Tyrion will be allowed to join the Night 's Watch after being found guilty of Joffrey 's murder , provided he pleads for mercy .
Joffrey,Tywin bluntly responds that it 's good someone has finally been able to manipulate Joffrey , as Cersei herself has clearly proven to be incapable of doing it .
Joffrey,Tywin brings up Oberyn 's knowledge of poisons and the link between that and Joffrey 's death - as some say the King was poisoned - and wonders whether Oberyn had helped Tyrion .
Joffrey,Tywin interrupts Oberyn Martell and his group sex act with Ellaria Sand and Olyvar to discuss Tyrion 's up-coming trial for the murder of Joffrey .
Joffrey,Tywin is adamant that Cersei , whom he calls the Kingdom 's most beautiful woman , should marry Loras , the Kingdom 's most handsome and desired bachelor , but Olenna blatantly refuses to consent , hinting that Joffrey is the result of incest .
Joffrey,Unfortunately , the attempt fails horrifically : instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes , Joffrey brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber .
Joffrey,Varys announces that Selmy is to be given a castle and land in recognition of his years of service , but the old knight , insulted by what he sees as being offered `` a hall to die in and men to bury me , '' takes off his armor , throws his sword at Joffrey 's feet and storms out , stating that he could still kill all five of the other Kingsguard present with ease .
Joffrey,Varys points out that Sansa is Joffrey 's aunt by marriage now ( and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords ) .
Joffrey,Varys tells Eddard that the council members heard about his `` troubles on the Kingsroad '' and that they pray for Joffrey 's recovery .
Joffrey,When Joffrey complains that he would have to climb too many steps should he wish to sit in on a small council meeting , Tywin silently ascends the steps to stand next to the throne , silently glares down at Joffrey , and then sardonically says he could arrange to have Joffrey carried .
Joffrey,When Joffrey keeps pushing the matter , Tyrion slams his dagger into the table and threatens that Joffrey will `` be fucking [ his ] own bride with a wooden cock '' if he does n't let it drop .
Joffrey,When Joffrey naively defends Margaery and criticizes his mother , Cersei realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered .
Joffrey,When Joffrey protests that he has n't been counseled on anything , Tywin says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform Joffrey should he deem it necessary .
Joffrey,When Joffrey refuses , saying the boy means nothing to him , Tyrion slaps him three times until he accepts his uncle 's suggestion .
Joffrey,When Lancel comes to tell her that Stannis has reached the walls Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey back to the Red Keep , ignoring his protests that it would damage morale .
Joffrey,When questioned , Margaery says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty , but Joffrey implies that this still means he must have had sex with her .
Joffrey,While Joffrey has previously been easy for Margaery to manipulate , Cersei was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind ; the fact that Margaery was married to his uncle Renly ( and thus , already had sex with another man ) , whom Cersei described as a `` traitor and known degenerate '' .
Joffrey,With King Joffrey dead , Cersei mourns the death of her elder son with the heir apparent and , still holding Joffrey in her arms , demands that Sansa Stark be found .
Joffrey Baratheon,As part of the magical ritual that follows , Stannis throws the leeches into the flames at Melisandre 's direction , and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn : `` The usurper Robb Stark , the usurper Balon Greyjoy , the usurper Joffrey Baratheon . ''
Joffrey Baratheon,King Joffrey Baratheon holds a tournament to celebrate his nameday on the walls of the Red Keep .
Joffrey Baratheon,King Joffrey Baratheon is being fitted for new clothes in his chambers , in preparation for his upcoming wedding to Margaery Tyrell .
Joffrey Baratheon,King Joffrey Baratheon is full of bravado , but his mother is worried about letting him fight .

Jojen,Amidst the confusion Jojen is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before Meera can fight it off .
Jojen,Arriving at the abandoned Nightfort , Meera Reed tells Bran , Hodor and Jojen that the castle is safe to enter .
Jojen,As Meera begs Jojen to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward , Bran calls out to them , revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that Bran has seen in his visions .
Jojen,As they approach the tree , wights burst up from the snow , grabbing Jojen 's ankles and attempting to drag him under the ice .
Jojen,At Craster 's Keep , Locke scouts the keep for the party of the Night 's Watch sent to eliminate the traitors holed up there ; in his reconnaissance , Locke finds the hut where Bran Stark , Jojen , Meera and Hodor are being held captive .
Jojen,At the urging of Jojen , Bran enters the mind of Summer , his direwolf , to aid Jon .
Jojen,Bran and Jojen wake in their camp in the woods , disappointed that he could not follow the three-eyed raven .
Jojen,Bran asks if prophetic dreams are part of being a warg , but Jojen explains that 's a different , related ability .
Jojen,Bran spots Jon in the fighting , but Jojen prevents him from going to his older brother , reminding Bran that they must continue onward to reach the three-eyed raven and that Jon would stop them .
Jojen,He continues by stating that Jojen died so that Bran could come here and regain what he has lost .
Jojen,Jojen advises Bran that he must follow the raven , and when he is confused , Jojen points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree .
Jojen,Jojen confirms that Bran 's dream of his father Eddard the day he died was an example of the Sight , and that Jojen himself had a similar dream the same day .
Jojen,Jojen confirms that Bran was n't simply experiencing a vision of Jojen in his earlier dream , but that he reached out with his mind to contact Bran in his dream , and that he remembers seeing the three-eyed raven too .
Jojen,Jon secures volunteers while Bran , Jojen , Meera and Hodor stumble on shelter .
Jojen,Just as the life drains from Jojen 's eyes , she launches a fireball at his body , immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight ( and fulfilling Jojen 's vision that his death would involve fire ) .
Jojen,Meera attempts to defend Jojen from the wights , but they begin to swarm over Hodor , who is too scared to fight back .
Jojen,Meera hesitates , but Jojen urges her to save herself .
Jojen,Meera is upset that her brother died to reach him , but the Three-eyed Raven says that Jojen ( who possessed the Greensight , as Bran does ) always knew that he would die helping Bran arrive here , but that he came nonetheless .
Jojen,Some of the deserters amuse themselves by tormenting Hodor , while the others are taken to Karl , who threatens to kill Meera and Jojen .
Jojen,That night , Karl enters the prisoners ' hut and attempts to rape Meera , but Jojen distracts Karl when he reveals his possession of greensight and claims to have seen Karl dead before the night is out .
Jojen,That night Bran asks Osha to take Rickon ( who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to Bran or Robb ) to Last Hearth , the home of House Umber , while he , Meera and Jojen head through the Wall in search of the Three-eyed raven .

Jon,A furious Alliser Thorne comes in and tells Jon that this charity wo n't help Sam harden up to survive the winter that is coming .
Jon,Aemon , however , realizes that Jon is speaking the truth , and the hearing ends with Jon being allowed to keep his head , although after Jon leaves , Thorne expresses his distrust for Jon .
Jon,Aemon remarks that he can not make Jon stay or go ; like the Maester , Jon must make the choice himself , and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life .
Jon,Aemon tells Jon that half the men at Castle Black already hate him , but that he should trust in his command .
Jon,After Grenn takes a very weak blow from Sam and yields , Ser Alliser scolds Jon for his rebellious actions .
Jon,After a fierce duel , Jon mortally wounds Qhorin per Qhorin 's own instructions , who whispers to Jon `` We are the watchers on the Wall '' before he breathes his last , signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding Jon that he must find out all he can about the wildlings ' plans and get back to the Wall .

Jon,As the new Lord Commander , Jon goes over paperwork with Samwell Tarly , letters they have received from minor Houses offering up a handful of new recruits .
Jon,As they enter the camp , Jon is shocked to see a real-life giant walk past .
Jon,As they talk , Jon kneels before the man , whom he assumes to be Mance Rayder , and calls him `` Your Grace '' as he would a king south of the Wall .
Jon,At Castle Black , a war council is called , and is attended by Sansa , Brienne , Podrick , Jon , Davos , Melisandre , Tormund and Eddison Tollett , who discuss the need for more men to defend Castle Black , since the Karstarks and Umbers , two major Houses in the North , have declared for Ramsay .
Jon,At Castle Black , nightfall has arrived and the band of black brothers loyal to Jon have not yet surrendered .
Jon,At that moment , Rast rushes in to warn Karl the keep is under attack ; Jon 's party rushes through the defenses and starts killing their traitorous former brethren .
Jon,At the Wall , Jon orders the recruits to go easy on Sam , but Rast refuses , saying that if Ser Alliser orders him to fight 'Lady Piggy ' , he will slice himself off a side of bacon .
Jon,At the Wall , the mutineers have left Jon 's body where he fell .
Jon,At the hearing , Jon admits to killing Qhorin Halfhand but says that it was not murder , rather Qhorin wanted Jon to kill him to give Jon credibility with the wildlings in order to get a spy into Mance 's army .
Jon,At the urging of Jojen , Bran enters the mind of Summer , his direwolf , to aid Jon .
Jon,At their parting Eddard tells Jon that , though he does not have Eddard 's name , he has his blood .
Jon,Atop the Wall , Eddison Tollett , who Jon left in command of the defenses , orders the men to drop the 'scythe . '
Jon,Before Jon leaves , he remembers the promise he made to Jeor Mormont and decides to leave Longclaw with Sam .
Jon,Before departing back for Castle Black , Jon has Craster 's Keep burned to the ground , along with the bodies of all those who died there .
Jon,Before he can finish Jon , one of Craster 's wives , Sissy , stabs him from behind .
Jon,Before leaving Castle Black , Sansa presents Jon with a new cloak like their father 's , carrying the Stark sigil .
Jon,Before they leave , Sam gives Jon some of his dragonglass weapons , reminding him of their use against the White Walkers .
Jon,Before they leave the wildling camp , Jon also urges Stannis to burn the dead before nightfall .
Jon,Benjen Stark meets Jon atop the Wall and tells him he is going on a ranging in the Haunted Forest .

Jon,Bran reluctantly leaves despite being so close to Jon .
Jon,Bran spots Jon in the fighting , but Jojen prevents him from going to his older brother , reminding Bran that they must continue onward to reach the three-eyed raven and that Jon would stop them .
Jon,Brienne silences Jaime ; Arya receives a gift from Jaqen ; Dany goes to a strange place ; Jon proves himself to Qhorin .
Jon,By killing Qhorin , the wildlings believe Jon has betrayed his oath and release him .
Jon,Catelyn explains that the boy was Jon Snow , and at first the thought that Jon would conveniently die of natural causes made her inwardly pray to the Seven for his end .
Jon,Commander Mormont witnessed the incident and confines Jon to quarters for his trouble .
Jon,Convinced , Jon , along with Sam , say their oath of fealty to the Night 's Watch in front of a heart tree just inside the eaves of the Haunted Forest and are acknowledged as men of the Watch .
Jon,Craster orders the men of the Night 's Watch out of his home , blaming Jon .
Jon,Davos , having returned to Castle Black at Stannis ' orders , urges Jon to convince the Wildlings for aid .
Jon,Davos , however , asks what a man of the Night 's Watch is doing in the camp , and Jon explains that he came to treaty with the King-Beyond-the-Wall .
Jon,Davos Seaworth , having returned to the room , is shocked but relieved and quickly helps Jon as he struggles to walk .
Jon,Davos asks Jon if he remembers anything .
Jon,Davos asks Melisandre to leave them alone so Jon can adjust to his revival .
Jon,Davos is confused given that even if Jon did decide to resupply them the provisions probably would n't reach them in time , and wonders why Stannis would send him instead of just a messenger .
Jon,Davos responds they are hopelessly outnumbered , stating Ghost is n't enough when Edd brings him up , before reminding them there are others nearby who owe Jon their lives .
Jon,Davos suggests waiting until Jon returns with the wildlings , but Stannis decides against it , as any delay improves the Boltons ' chances .
Jon,During the journey through the woods , a clearly jealous Orell confronts Ygritte and says that he would be a better man for her than Jon Snow , while continuing to express his distrust in Jon .
Jon,Edd scolds Jon for leaving the Night 's Watch after taking an oath , to which Jon replies that he gave his life for the Night 's Watch and ca n't trust his brothers .
Jon,Even Jon 's friend Edd rejects this decision , stating that the wildlings killed their friends Grenn and Pyp .
Jon,Even after being warned that he is disobeying a direct order , he flippantly tells Jon that he can take his order and 'shove it up his bastard arse . '
Jon,From across the courtyard , Stannis Baratheon sees Jon behead Janos for refusing his orders , and slightly nods in approval .
Jon,Ghost then finds his way back to Jon , who is overjoyed to see his companion again .
Jon,Grenn is amongst the casualties and Jon tells Sam that all bodies must be burned .
Jon,Having been told of Robb 's death , Jon shares with Samwell Tarly that he had always been jealous of Robb for having more of their father 's affection and for being better than him at riding and fighting , and with girls .
Jon,Having publicly disobeyed and insulted Jon , the Lord Commander orders Janos taken outside , and calls for Olly to fetch him his sword .
Jon,Having reached safety , Jon is brought inside the castle by the guards , where he encounters Sam and Pypar , who are overjoyed to see him and insist that his injuries be taken care of .
Jon,He also assures Jon that Stannis 's leadership advice is offered because the king has taken a liking to him .
Jon,He also promises Jon to tell him about his mother the next time they meet .
Jon,He and Jon share a moment of fellowship before Tyrion departs for the capital in the company of Yoren .
Jon,He had caught Jon spying on him while he left a baby in the forest for the White Walkers and has beaten him bloody .
Jon,He hands out assignments , but to Jon 's disgust he is being sent to the stewards , not the rangers .
Jon,He insists that the boys must go north to the Wall , as there are too many enemies in the south and Jon will be able to keep them safe and tell their mother of their survival .
Jon,He is finally subdued by Jon with a crossbow and taken prisoner by the Night 's Watch for interrogation .
Jon,He leaves the fate of the wildling prisoners in Jon 's hands , allowing Jon to decide whether to execute them or to see if Tormund is more willing to negotiate than Mance .
Jon,He notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that Jon might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself , but that Jon must have known he would die assassinating Mance .
Jon,He refuses to take Jon with him , telling him he is n't ready , and that here rank and nobility mean nothing : every man must earn everything he gets .
Jon,He reminds Jon that the Night 's Watch has sworn an oath of political neutrality .
Jon,He says that Jon will not enjoy being Lord Commander , but with luck , he may find the strength to do what needs to be done .
Jon,He says that he does n't care , but his interest is piqued on hearing that Jon killed Qhorin Halfhand .
Jon,He says the meat tastes so much better south of the Wall , and chides Tormund for losing their warg as well as Jon .
Jon,He then says that Jon bringing the Wildlings was a dangerous problem and had to be stopped , and warns him that Jon will be fighting their battles forever .
Jon,He wants Jon to convince Mance Rayder to bend the knee and have the wildlings fight for him ; in exchange , he would set them free and give them their own land within Westeros .
Jon,Hearing the dogs still after them , Theon tries to lead them away , telling Sansa to keep heading north for Jon and Castle Black .
Jon,His uncle Benjen Stark , First Ranger of the Night 's Watch , arrives to join the feast , and Jon asks him to take him back to the Wall with him .
Jon,However , Catelyn then became horrified at herself for thinking such a thing , particularly as Jon was an innocent child , and the person Catelyn really hated was Jon 's unidentified mother .
Jon,However , Mance calls Jon 's bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending Castle Black , he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the Wall , and they will attack Castle Black 's weak southern side as soon as he gives the order .
Jon,However , Sam suggests to Jon that while this move was possibly orchestrated by Ser Alliser Thorne to punish Jon , it is also an opportunity for the Lord Commander to groom Jon directly for command .
Jon,However , when the party attacks the farmstead , Jon surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword , alerting the old man who flees ; Jon also distracts Ygritte when she tries to shoot the fleeing man with an arrow .
Jon,Impressed , the Lord of Bones cuts Jon free .
Jon,In response , Edd states he does n't care because Jon was his friend and they butchered him , then he rallies the loyal brothers to try and take out Thorne in revenge .
Jon,In response to Rast 's comments , Jon goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf Ghost to intimidate Rast into playing along .
Jon,It is shot by Jon , giving the man he respected an easier death .
Jon,It turns out that Sam had been sent to retrieve Jon , who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers , including Maester Aemon , acting Lord Commander Alliser Thorne , First Builder Othell Yarwyck , and the exiled former Lord Commander of the King 's Landing City Watch , Janos Slynt .
Jon,Janos Slynt points out to Thorne that Jon is well liked and Thorne is not , and when Maester Aemon insists upon an election for a new Lord Commander , Jon is far more likely to succeed Mormont .
Jon,Janos believes the lie and leaves , allowing Jon to take command of the Wall 's defenses .
Jon,Jeor predicts that whatever it was Jon will see it again .
Jon,Jeor reprimands Jon , noting that Craster may be disgusting , but the Night 's Watch needs him .
Jon,Jon Snow 's attempts at training Olly are interrupted by Melisandre , who has been sent to fetch Jon for an audience with Stannis .
Jon,Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly are standing watch atop the Wall when Benjen 's horse is spotted returning , but , to Jon 's horror , there is no sign of Benjen himself .
Jon,Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister depart Winterfell for the Wall , and along the way Jon discovers his ideas of the Night 's Watch may not match the reality .
Jon,Jon accepts after Mance assures him that if he 'd wanted to kill Jon , poison would be the last of his methods .
Jon,Jon also tries to persuade Ygritte that the wildlings ' cause is doomed to failure , but she refuses to listen and points out that Jon is technically one of them ; if it fails , so does he .
Jon,Jon angrily charges at him with a knife and Thorne is only saved by Grenn and Pyp holding Jon back .
Jon,Jon approaches Ser Alliser Thorne , who finally relents and admits that they should have heeded Jon 's advice and blocked the gates .
Jon,Jon confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by Qhorin Halfhand to get Jon to infiltrate Mance 's army , and that Qhorin tricked Mance into trusting Jon by allowing Jon to kill Qhorin himself in a fight .
Jon,Jon continues to kiss down her body as she insists that he has no experience and therefore `` You know nothing , Jon Sn -- '' but stops mid-word as Jon starts performing oral sex on her .
Jon,Jon points out that they can summon the rest of the minor Houses , such as the Mormonts , Glovers , Cerwyns , and Mazins , to rival their enemies , and Sansa reveals Brynden 's successful retaking of Riverrun , though she claims she learned via one of Ramsay 's ravens in order to stop Jon from pursuing Littlefinger .
Jon,Jon then moves on to Olly , who says nothing and glares furiously at Jon .
Jon,Just as the party leaves , Jon finds a sixth pup , an albino runt of the litter .
Jon,Later , when Jon and Sam are cleaning the dining hall , they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman .
Jon,Later on , Alliser Thorne taunts Jon that his father is a traitor , calling him , `` not just a bastard , a traitor 's bastard . ''
Jon,Later on , several of the other recruits gang up on Jon , but the situation is defused by Tyrion .
Jon,Locke brings Jon to Thorne , who sanctions his mission but tells Jon that he must secure volunteers rather than have men ordered along with him .
Jon,Lord Commander Jeor Mormont decides to overlook Jon 's brief desertion , saying many have fled the Wall , only to think better of it and return .
Jon,Lord Commander Jeor Mormont questions Jon about his actions .
Jon,Mance 's guards safely grab Jon during the distraction , and Mance demands to know if the Night 's Watch is attacking them , but Jon admits that it 's just as Mance said : the Night 's Watch does n't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the Wall and attack .
Jon,Mance asks Jon why he wants to join them .
Jon,Mance asks about Ygritte and Jon reveals that she died at the Battle of Castle Black , though not by his hands .
Jon,Mance brings Jon inside his tent , and questions his status as a traitor .
Jon,Mance brings Jon to one of his scouts , Orell .
Jon,Mance guesses there are no more than 50 men left guarding Castle Black , but Jon lies and insists that there are still over 1,000 men defending the garrison .
Jon,Mance himself is an unassuming man sitting in a corner , who then introduces himself and tells Jon to stand , as no man kneels before another among the Free Folk , as they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture .
Jon,Mance is satisfied and advises Jon to get a new cloak .
Jon,Mance is shocked and questions Jon if this is what the Night 's Watch has sunk to : killing a man who let him into his own tent , accepting a parley in good faith , who shared food and drink with him , and who even offered him ( relatively ) reasonable peace terms .
Jon,Mance orders Tormund to take Jon with him , as Jon knows the layout of Castle Black , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty : if it turns out that he wo n't really betray the Night 's Watch , Tormund can easily throw him off the Wall to his death .
Jon,Mance ruefully notes that the giant was named Mag the Mighty , and he was `` king '' of the giants , the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the First Men entered Westeros , to which Jon then glibly notes that his friend Grenn was from a farm .
Jon,Mance says he is glad that Jon killed Qhorin , as he had killed many of Mance 's wildlings , though he notes that Qhorin was his brother once , back when he was a member of the Night 's Watch and Qhorin had a whole hand .
Jon,Mance says that he is a `` warg '' , and Ygritte is surprised that Jon does n't know what that is .
Jon,Mance then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out , and Jon informs Mance that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend Grenn .
Jon,Mance then notices that Jon is eyeing a cooking knife , and quickly deduces that Jon came to parley with Mance simply so he could assassinate him .
Jon,Mance warns Jon that all of the missing corpses from the Fist are no longer his friends and brothers from the Night 's Watch , but have been resurrected as undead monsters who serve the White Walkers .
Jon,Many of the wildlings are surprised to see Jon in his all-black Night 's Watch clothing and shout `` Crow ! ''
Jon,Meanwhile , Samwell Tarly is fretting about Gilly 's safety in Mole 's Town with the wildlings loose , and it is revealed that Sam told Jon about Bran still being alive and north of the wall .
Jon,Melisandre arrives , stating she saw Jon fighting in Winterfell in the flames .
Jon,Melisandre seduces Jon .
Jon,Melisandre seems intrigued , her piercing stare clearly making Jon uneasy .
Jon,Mormont also reinstates Jon to his former position and tells him he has dispatched Ser Alliser Thorne to King 's Landing to lay the hand of the wight they found at the feet of the King and ask for aid .
Jon,Mormont asks Jon if someday he wants to lead and tells him that first he needs to `` learn how to follow . ''
Jon,Mormont himself is disgusted by Craster 's human sacrifices ( not to mention his incestuous relationships with his own daughters ) , but he will not interfere , and forbids Jon from doing so , as Craster was helped many members of the Night 's Watch , among them , Benjen Stark .
Jon,Mormont tells Jon that the war between the Lannisters and Starks is less important than what they face now , a renewed threat from the wildlings , White Walkers , and wights .
Jon,Much to Thorne and Slynt 's surprise , Grenn , Eddison Tollett and a group of other men join Jon on his mission , including Locke who asks to say his vows if that is required before he goes north of the Wall .
Jon,Nevertheless , Jon decides to go ahead with his plan .
Jon,Noticing them , and realizing the need for dragonglass , Jon and Loboda go to the burning townhall , only to be confronted by a White Walker warrior .
Jon,On the ride to the top of the Wall , Jon is discomfited by Melisandre 's presence and questions .
Jon,On top of the Wall , Jon hears the horn blowing and looks north , witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the North , just as Mance had promised .
Jon,Once the room is empty however , Ghost , who had been sleeping underneath the table upon which Jon was lying , perks up , and Jon suddenly awakens , gasping for air .
Jon,One of his pursuers hits a tree branch and is unhorsed , and Jon realizes it was Sam .
Jon,Orell decides that Tormund can not continue climbing with the weight of Jon and Ygritte 's bodies pulling them down and begins cutting the rope .
Jon,Orell tells Jon that he does n't see Ygritte complaining about what happened because she is a wildling and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation , also telling Jon that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her .
Jon,Outside , Tormund moves to kill the old man , but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty .
Jon,Qhorin enrages Jon by insulting his parentage .
Jon,Qhorin initiates a plan to install Jon as a spy within the wildling ranks .
Jon,Qhorin realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings , so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword , attacking Jon with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery .
Jon,Ramsay is obviously angered by Sansa 's remarks , but does n't act on it , simply stating that bastards can rise in the world too , informing her of Jon 's appointment as Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch .
Jon,Realizing that Jon is still loyal to the Night 's Watch , Tormund orders his men to kill Jon ; Tormund restrains Ygritte to stop her trying to help Jon , and soon after Jon battles with Orell .
Jon,Realizing this is true , Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer : if he leaves the Night 's Watch , Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell , so he can rally the North to Stannis 's side and resume the fight against the Boltons , Freys , and Lannisters .
Jon,Robb Stark says farewell to Jon .
Jon,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Jon,Saddened , Mance proposes that they drink a toast to her memory , but Jon is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink .
Jon,Saddened , Tormund implores Jon that Ygritte 's final resting place should be in `` the real north . ''
Jon,Sam arrives atop the Wall to ask Jon for more men to defend the castle , and Jon tasks Sam with releasing Ghost from his pen to assist in the fighting .
Jon,Sam asks Jon if he can travel to Oldtown to study and replace Aemon as the new Maester of the Watch .
Jon,Sam attempts to interrogate Jon about what it was like to be with a woman , stating that as their deaths are likely imminent , it may be his last chance to find out .
Jon,Sam decided to take the oath with Jon to the Old Gods of the Forest , as the Seven gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him .
Jon,Sam explains this is a hard choice Jon had to make , however unpopular , and then tells him not to worry , as Jon always comes back .

Jon,Sam promises he will return , they toast to that and Jon sees his only friend off .
Jon,Sam reassures Olly that Jon knows what he is doing , and that unless he is successful , neither the Night 's Watch nor Westeros stands a chance against the White Walkers .

Jon,Seizing on whatever hope she still has , however , she says that the Lord of Light brought Jon back for a reason ; that Stannis was not The Prince That Was Promised , but `` someone must be . ''
Jon,Seizing the opportunity , Jon strikes the White Walker , shattering his body into fragments of ice , confirming that Valyrian steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass .

Jon,She argues with Jon , criticizing him for ignoring their common descent from the First Men .
Jon,She encourages Snow to take her , as the Lord of Light made humans male and female for a reason ; although clearly tempted , Jon refuses , citing his vows , and the fact that Stannis would n't approve ( to which Melisandre suggests they not tell him ) .
Jon,She is worried that Jon discovered something he should n't have , and may have told someone .
Jon,She mocks Jon 's sexual repression and surmises that he is a virgin .

Jon,Slynt refuses Jon not once , but three times .
Jon,So she made a prayer wheel and stayed up with him all night , praying to the gods that if they forgave her earlier wish that Jon would die , she promised she would urge Eddard to have Jon legitimized as a Stark and she would raise him as her own son .

Jon,Speaking to Craster 's wives , Jon warns them that Mance Rayder 's army and worse besides will soon reach their location and offers to take them to safety south of the Wall , but the women refuse , preferring to set out on their own .
Jon,Stannis insists that it is because he needs his Hand of the King to engage in diplomacy to win Jon over - but in reality , Stannis sends Davos away so he would n't be around to stop what Stannis was planning on doing next .
Jon,Stannis proclaims that Eddard was an honorable man , and asks Jon what Ned would have done with Mance .
Jon,Stannis shows Jon a message he received from Lady Lyanna Mormont in response to the demand that House Mormont pledge itself to Stannis ' cause .
Jon,Stannis tempts Jon .

Jon,Theon mockingly points out that this one belongs to Jon .
Jon,They plan to attack him to steal his horses and gold , but Jon insists that the old man is no threat to them .
Jon,They reach the top of the wall , and Ygritte is awed by the view beyond the wall and to the south , before she and Jon share a passionate kiss .
Jon,They surround him and recite their oath to the Night 's Watch , and Jon realizes they are right : leaving would make him a deserter and oathbreaker , something his father would never countenance if he were alive , and Jon does n't even know if Robb would accept his help or turn him over to the authorities .
Jon,They take the body inside where Edd clears a table and angrily curses Thorne after closing Jon 's eyes .
Jon,This makes Stannis regard Jon more seriously .
Jon,Thorne is disgusted at the poor performance of the others but has no praise for Jon either , dubbing him Lord Snow and describing him as `` the least useless person here '' .
Jon,Thorne tries to turn it into a game , ordering three trainees take on Sam 's protector ( taunting Jon that he has found a new Lady love ) , but Jon nevertheless fends them all off .
Jon,Though Jon is able to stab the wight through the chest with his sword , the wight simply removes the sword and is unharmed .

Jon,Tormund warns Jon .
Jon,Traveling north , Jon and Tyrion talk , and Tyrion reveals that he reads books to sharpen his mind , his greatest asset and weapon .

Jon,Tyrion gains new responsibilities ; Jon is taken to the Fist of the First Men ; Daenerys meets with the slavers ; Jaime strikes a deal with his captors .
Jon,Tyrion points out to Jon that none of the other recruits had the benefit of a skilled master-at-arms to train them , and that Jon is alienating them through his standoffish attitude and superior combat skills .
Jon,Tyrion tells Jon that the Night 's Watch is not a noble institution of glorious knights defending the realm against the horrors lurking beyond the Wall , but a dumping ground for the unwanted and for criminals .

Jon,When Stannis suggests appointing Alliser Thorne as the new commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea , Jon retorts that `` it is better to have your enemies close by than far away . ''
Jon,When further pressed by Sam to describe lying down with Ygritte , Jon attempts to explain but is unable to properly express it , proclaiming exasperatedly that he 's `` not a bleeding poet . ''
Jon,When he asks her if reviving Jon is possible , she admits to having seen it done , but insists that she can not do it , having lost faith in the Lord of Light due to the failure of her predictions regarding Stannis Baratheon to come true .

Jon Arryn,Eddard asks Littlefinger why Jon Arryn was searching for Robert 's bastards but he says he does n't know , offering the half-hearted guess that maybe Robert suddenly took paternal interest in them .
Jon Arryn,Eddard discovers the secret Jon Arryn died for .

Jon Snow,Reporting back to Jon Snow and the others , Locke tells them that only 11 traitors are present and most of them are drunk and wo n't prove much of a threat .
Jon Snow,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Jon Snow,Sansa says she already has an army , her brother Jon Snow 's army of wildlings .

Jon Snow,Ygritte starts disrobing , and says that she wants to make sure Jon Snow has truly come over to the wildlings ' side and broken his Night 's Watch vows - by making him break his oath of celibacy with her .
Jon Stark,Realizing this is true , Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer : if he leaves the Night 's Watch , Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell , so he can rally the North to Stannis 's side and resume the fight against the Boltons , Freys , and Lannisters .
Jorah,A stunned Jorah admits he does ; the stranger before them is one of the most skilled fighters in Westeros : Ser Barristan Selmy , Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon 's Kingsguard .
Jorah,After a suspenseful pause by Jorah , Daario strides into the room and kneels before the Queen .
Jorah,After confirming to each other that they had not been touched by the stone men , Jorah tells Tyrion that he hopes to find a fishing village and get a boat soon , otherwise they 'll have to walk all the way around Slaver 's Bay to eventually reach Meereen .
Jorah,An undetermined amount of time later , Tyrion wakes up and finds himself on a shore , dragged out of the water by Jorah .
Jorah,As Jorah and Tyrion continue their journey to Meereen , and following Jorah 's violent reaction to a previous conversation , Tyrion tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are .
Jorah,As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon , Tyrion deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of Old Valyria , a shorter route to Meereen and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria 's reputation .
Jorah,As Tyrion watches Daario and Jorah depart the city , Varys calmly walks up to Tyrion .
Jorah,As the captains depart , Ser Barristan asks to go along , but Jorah reminds him that a Queensguard 's place is at the Queen 's side , regardless of his pride .
Jorah,As they catch glimpses of domes , towers and aqueducts , Tyrion recites a poem about the Doom of Valyria , with Jorah joining in at the end .
Jorah,As they walk , Tyrion asks why Jorah would support Daenerys Targaryen and how she would be better than any other rulers , or why Westeros would even support her , given that her father was the Mad King .
Jorah,Asking him whether he claims the pardon was forged , Jorah admits that it was not .
Jorah,At Jorah 's insistence , Daario smashes Aggo 's skull with a rock so that no one will think he was killed with a bladed weapon .
Jorah,At the sight of the mythical animals born anew , an amazed Jorah and the few remaining Dothraki kneel and swear their allegiance to the Mother of Dragons .
Jorah,At this moment Jorah suddenly grabs and hurls a spear at the royal box - embedding itself in a Son of the Harpy sneaking up behind Daario .
Jorah,Barristan says she 'll have good men to advise her , though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with Jorah at her side when they return to Westeros ; Jorah admits that he may never be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves , which is abhorred in Westeros .
Jorah,Barristan surmises Jorah spied on Daenerys in exchange for the pardon .
Jorah,Before Yezzan leaves , Tyrion convinces him that Jorah and he are a team , and is also bought .
Jorah,Before the Unsullied can comply , Jorah declares that he brought her a gift , and Tyrion enters the arena and reveals his identity to the astonished Queen .
Jorah,Both Jorah and Selmy strongly object , and plead to Daenerys that while soldiers are valuable , it is dragons that will ultimately win her the Iron Throne .
Jorah,Contemplating his greyscale , Jorah returns to Yezzan zo Qaggaz and offers to fight for him .
Jorah,Daario and Jorah are looking for Daenerys , and come upon the charred remains of a ram .

Jorah,Daario takes care of Iggo while Akho tackles Jorah .
Jorah,Daenerys , Jorah and Barristan hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the Second Sons , a professional mercenary company , the `` powerful friends '' the Yunkish have employed .
Jorah,Daenerys Targaryen arrives at House of the Undying and is magically separated from Jorah and Kovarro .
Jorah,Daenerys considers for a moment and then tells Jorah to assign Hizdahr zo Loraq as her ambassador to offer the masters a choice : they can live free in the new world she wants to create , or they can die clinging to their old one .
Jorah,Daenerys dismisses everyone but Jorah and muses that her plans are in shambles .
Jorah,Daenerys exiles Jorah from the city .
Jorah,Daenerys expresses interest in expanding her tiny Dothraki khalasar ( most of them are seasick because the Dothraki have never traveled on ships before ) , but Jorah says that other Dothraki will only join her if they think she is strong , and for that she needs an army .
Jorah,Daenerys is distracted by a playing child following her and Jorah , and neither notice a man in a hooded black cloak following them , armed with a dagger .
Jorah,Daenerys is unsure of what to do with Jorah , having banished him twice , seeing him defiantly return twice , and him twice saving her life .
Jorah,Daenerys stresses that they are slave-soldiers , a distinction which may make some look on her negatively in Westeros where slavery is illegal , but Jorah says they have no better ideas for how to acquire an army .
Jorah,Daenerys tells Jorah that she sent Daario to take the Second Sons to Yunkai to regain control over the city and kill the masters that have resurfaced .
Jorah,Daenerys tells Jorah to find out more about Yunkai 's `` powerful friends '' before she commits herself to an attack on the city .
Jorah,Grey Worm , Jorah and Barristan all volunteer to stand as her champion ; she refuses all three as too valuable to her .
Jorah,Grey Worm , still recovering from his injuries , offers to go with Jorah and Daario , as does Tyrion .
Jorah,Grey Worm tells her that Jorah taught it to him .
Jorah,He glares at the seller and then goes to Daenerys to ensure she is okay , before offering Jorah the reward of any horse he chooses for foiling the assassination .
Jorah,He is so weak and ineffectual that he could n't command an army even if Drogo gave him one , to which Jorah agrees .
Jorah,He promises to lead Yezzan 's team to the Great Pit and win the tournament for the Queen - after that Yezzan can make a fortune selling Jorah on the black market .
Jorah,He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he did n't commit , and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved - Jorah nods , as this seems as likely a motivation for Kinslaying as any .
Jorah,He says he knows that Jorah wants Daenerys , but he does n't care .
Jorah,However , as Tyrion is tied up , he is cornered at one end of the boat with a stone man advancing on him while Jorah battles more at the other end .
Jorah,Ignoring Jorah 's pleas , she kisses his cheek , and sets the pyre alight .
Jorah,In an audience before her , a seething Daenerys demands an explanation , and Jorah says it is a ploy by Tywin Lannister to divide them .
Jorah,In spite of Jorah 's previous successes , he has decidedly mixed results in the grand melee he finds himself in .
Jorah,In the Throne Room , Daenerys ponders on what to do with Tyrion and Jorah .
Jorah,It becomes apparent that Jorah is trying to figure out if Barristan knew that Jorah was initially a spy for King Robert , reporting back to Varys .
Jorah,Jorah and Barristan briefly bicker about the fact that Barristan only just came to them , while Jorah was defending Daenerys from Robert Baratheon 's assassins for months , and Barristan is n't Lord Commander here ; Jorah takes his orders from Daenerys .
Jorah,Jorah is relieved that Barristan was therefore not present at any council meeting so he could n't have learned that Jorah was sending it reports on Daenerys .
Jorah,King Robert Baratheon himself knighted Jorah for his bravery that day , the proudest of Jorah 's life , though he says what he was most thinking about was that he really needed to piss because he 'd been sealed in metal plate armor for sixteen hours straight .
Jorah,Later , she seeks Jorah 's advice about the proposal and he cautions against accepting financial aid .
Jorah,Later when they are at sea , Tyrion urges for Jorah to remove his gag .
Jorah,Meanwhile , a Braavosi Water Dancer easily dispatches his Dothraki opponent , and then focuses his attention on Jorah .
Jorah,On Jorah 's orders , the Dothraki seize Xaro 's gold and jewels while Daenerys triumphantly watches with her three dragons .
Jorah,Quaithe knows that Jorah once betrayed Daenerys by spying on her .
Jorah,Quaithe warns Jorah that the man who stole the dragons is already with Daenerys .
Jorah,Seeing Daenerys with a wineseller who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the Arbor , Jorah realizes that the wine has been poisoned ; this is the assassination attempt .
Jorah,Ser Jorah and others try to explain this to Daenerys , but she is disturbed to see the aftermath , the Dothraki killing the villagers and raping their women , and orders it stopped .
Jorah,Ser Jorah believes that Daenerys intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider , as they can sell the eggs and travel far away .
Jorah,Ser Jorah notes with wisdom however that Yunkai 's defenders wo n't fight them in open battle , being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the Targaryen army with guerrilla tactics .
Jorah,Ser Jorah swears fealty to Viserys as King and offers him his support and advice , which is accepted .
Jorah,Ser Jorah tells her to look away , but she wo n't .
Jorah,She also says to let Daario know that it was Jorah who changed her mind .
Jorah,She asks Jorah to help convince her husband since the Seven Kingdoms are hers by birthright but he reminds her that her ancestor Aegon the Conqueror took six of the Seven Kingdoms , because he was capable of doing so ( due to his dragons ) , nothing more .
Jorah,She asks if Jorah knows the man .
Jorah,Spotting a slaver ship in the distance , Jorah pulls Tyrion to the ground .

Kingsguard,Cersei sobs with grief and orders the Kingsguard to seize Tyrion for the poisoning of her son .
Kingsguard,Cersei then dismisses Ser Barristan Selmy as head of the Kingsguard , noting that the time has come for an honorable retirement .
Kingsguard,Dismissive of the threat posed by Stannis following the Battle of the Blackwater , Joffrey leafs through the Book of Brothers , which details the history of the Kingsguard and those who served in it .
Kingsguard,Elsewhere , Robert swaps old war stories with Ser Barristan Selmy , a distinguished and famous knight and the commander of the Kingsguard .
Kingsguard,Falling to his knees , Ser Barristan explains that following Robert 's death and his dismissal by Joffrey , he has been searching for Daenerys Stormborn , to beg her forgiveness and offer his service , hoping to make amends for failing House Targaryen during and after Robert 's Rebellion , when he served in her father 's Kingsguard .
Kingsguard,He also questions Jaime 's ability to serve in the Kingsguard with one hand .
Kingsguard,He demands wine and walks away from the battle and his place in the Kingsguard , after saying in the presence of all , including the king , `` Fuck the kings guard .
Kingsguard,He wants Jaime to be his heir and return home to Casterly Rock , but Jaime insists on remaining in the Kingsguard .
Kingsguard,Heavy footsteps are heard , and Qyburn introduces Cersei to the newest member of the Kingsguard : a 7-8 foot tall man in golden armor .
Kingsguard,However , Barristan explains that as a former Kingsguard member under Aerys Targaryen , and one who 'd killed several of Robert 's friends , while Robert did n't mind keeping him in his position as a guard , he never really trusted his advice , so he left him out of Small Council meetings .
Kingsguard,In the chambers of the Kingsguard , Jaime tasks Brienne with finding Sansa .
Kingsguard,Joffrey then ponders that it does n't matter which Lannister gets her pregnant , and openly says he might want to rape her after Tyrion is done with her , while the Kingsguard hold her down .
Kingsguard,Meanwhile , an angry King Tommen Baratheon and his Kingsguard visits the High Sparrow to secure permission for Cersei to visit her daughter 's resting place in the Great Sept .
Kingsguard,Realizing her unchanged position on the matter , Tywin threatens to make Loras a knight of the Kingsguard , which would force Loras to give up his right to marriage and to inherit Highgarden .
Kingsguard,Renly , along with his Kingsguard members Brienne and Ser Loras Tyrell , counters that no one wants Stannis to be king .
Kingsguard,Selmy is confused , pointing out that Kingsguard serve for life , but Joffrey angrily says that Selmy is too old , and could n't protect his father .
Kingsguard,That night , Margaery enters Tommen 's chambers , slipping past the Kingsguard and charming Tommen .
Kingsguard,The Kingsguard request that Tommen let them kill the Faith Militant to pass .
Kingsguard,The two Kingsguard draw their swords , with Ser Arthur saying , `` And now it begins , '' to which Eddard replies `` now it ends . ''
Kingsguard,This comes as a shock , because his older brother Jaime gave up all right to inherit his father 's lands when he joined the Kingsguard , and Tyrion is rightfully the next in line of succession .
Kingsguard,Tommen naively thinks the High Sparrow will simply do as he requests , so he heads to the Great Sept of Baelor with five Kingsguard and several Lannister guards .
Kingsguard,Tyrion realizes that while Cersei certainly has the authority to command a Kingsguard , she is n't stupid enough to command Ser Mandon Moore to kill him in public .
Kingsguard,Tywin makes it clear that he considers Jaime his heir - despite the fact that as a Kingsguard member , Jaime has officially renounced all rights to inheritance .
Kingsguard,Varys announces that Selmy is to be given a castle and land in recognition of his years of service , but the old knight , insulted by what he sees as being offered `` a hall to die in and men to bury me , '' takes off his armor , throws his sword at Joffrey 's feet and storms out , stating that he could still kill all five of the other Kingsguard present with ease .
Kingsguard,When Ser Meryn tries to support the king , Tyrion silences the Kingsguard by ordering Bronn to kill Meryn if the knight opens his mouth again .
Kingslayer,Brienne catches him and calls for help for the Kingslayer , at which ( as he slips out of consciousness ) he whimpers to himself `` Jaime .
Kingslayer,Jaime asks if they want to negotiate , but Locke says they 'll have his head if he does n't bring the Kingslayer back to the King in the North , so there 's not much Jaime can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner .
Kingslayer,Ramsay greets his father and his new step-mother ( as well as privately congratulating Locke for his maiming of the Kingslayer ) .
Kingsmoot,As the Kingsmoot is held , Yara Greyjoy is the first to lay claim to the Salt Throne .
Kingsmoot,She swears to do this upon the Salt Throne and Aeron explains to her that she is n't the ruler yet , because the law says that the Kingsmoot chooses the next ruler .
Kingsroad,Days later , on the Kingsroad south to the capital , King Robert Baratheon calls a halt to discuss with Eddard some dire news that has just arrived .
Kingsroad,Eddard Stark and his daughters depart for King 's Landing , but an incident on the Kingsroad threatens to drive a wedge between him and King Robert .
Kingsroad,Gendry and Arya are travelling north on the Kingsroad with Yoren 's recruits .
Kingsroad,On the Kingsroad , the royal party reaches the Crossroads Inn , a noted waystop on the way south to the capital .
Kingsroad,Prince Joffrey comes to apologize to Sansa for the incident on the Kingsroad .
Kingsroad,Though Cersei attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the Kingsroad behind them , Eddard correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit .
Kingsroad,Varys tells Eddard that the council members heard about his `` troubles on the Kingsroad '' and that they pray for Joffrey 's recovery .
Kingswood,Renly complains as Robert is organizing a hunt in the Kingswood , which will no doubt involve traipsing around the forest for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal .
Kinslaying,He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he did n't commit , and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved - Jorah nods , as this seems as likely a motivation for Kinslaying as any .
Kinvara,To Tyrion 's surprise , Kinvara appears to be highly accommodating in supporting Tyrion 's goals , as she firmly believes that Daenerys is The Prince That Was Promised .
Kinvara,To that end , Tyrion invites Kinvara , High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis , to negotiate spreading the word of Daenerys 's accomplishments .

Kraznys,After the Sack of Astapor is finished , Daenerys walks past Kraznys ' charred remains , mounts a white horse , and addresses her Unsullied .

Kraznys,At the city of Astapor in Slaver 's Bay , Daenerys Targaryen arrives before Kraznys mo Nakloz and the other slave-masters of the city , with her Dothraki guards carrying the largest of her dragons , Drogon , in its large cage .

Kraznys,Daenerys speaks with Kraznys mo Nakloz , as he shows her his slave soldiers , the Unsullied .
Kraznys,Daenerys turns to face Kraznys and bluntly says `` A dragon is not a slave , '' again in perfectly-accented Valyrian .
Kraznys,Drogon breathes fire onto Kraznys , completely engulfing the slaver in flames as he thrashes about in his death throes .
Kraznys,En route back to their ship , Ser Jorah urges that Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied , arguing that under her command , these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under Kraznys and his ilk .
Kraznys,She hands the leash to Kraznys , and in return he gives her a cat-o-nine-tails with a hilt shaped like a Harpy , signifying ownership of the Unsullied .
Kraznys,She ignores them , and concludes the deal with Kraznys , and also demands Missandei as a token of faith .
Kraznys,This offer stops Kraznys in his tracks , yet Daenerys repeatedly affirms that he may only have one of her dragons .
Kraznys,Too distracted to notice , Kraznys complains for Missandei to tell `` the bitch '' that the dragon wo n't come when he commands .
Kraznys,Upon arriving at Astapor , Daenerys is given a tour of the Unsullied barracks by the Unsullied 's owner , Kraznys mo Nakloz , with his slave girl Missandei translating his Low Valyrian into the Common Tongue of Westeros for Daenerys .
Kraznys,When a dumbfounded Kraznys demands an explanation , she declares that she is Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen , of the blood of Old Valyria : Valyrian is her mother-tongue indicating she 'd been feigning ignorance the entire time ( and putting up with Kraznys ' insulting comments ) to lull them into a false sense of security .

Lannister,Tywin says that the laws of men say he has to let Tyrion use his family name , but that he wishes he could prove Tyrion was n't his son , so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name `` Lannister '' which he stole from Tywin .
Lannister,Tywin states that this will confirm that the Vale of Arryn , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support Robb Stark , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies ( other marriage alliances , with House Tyrell of the Reach and House Martell of Dorne , combined with the crushing of the Baratheons , have in turn secured the rest of southern Westeros under Lannister control ) .
Lannister,When they are confronted by Lannister guardsmen led by Sandor Clegane , Septa Mordane tells Sansa to run and lock herself in her room while she stays to confront them .
Lannister,[ 2 ] The next day Robb surveys the battlefield as Silent Sisters tend to both Stark and Lannister wounded , while his bannerman , Lord Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort , argues that they should kill all of the Lannister soldiers they took prisoner , because they 're having trouble supplying their own army and prisoners will slow them down .
Lannister Camp,At the Lannister Camp
Lannister Monster,Later , Tyrion is approached by Oberyn Martell , who tells Tyrion of his disappointment in their first encounter : as children , Oberyn and his sister Elia were told stories of the `` Lannister Monster '' and his extreme deformities .
Lannister-Tyrell,Olenna warns Cersei that her actions have endangered the Lannister-Tyrell alliance - the very alliance that is supplying the capital with food .
Lannister-Tyrell,Therefore , she asks that Littlefinger use his spies to try to find out what they 're up to , because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the Lannister-Tyrell alliance .
Lannister-Tyrell,Tywin explains that the desertion of the Karstarks have cost Robb Stark half his army , and ( combined with already being badly outnumbered by the Lannister-Tyrell alliance ) his days are now numbered .
Lannister/Tyrell,Robb shows Talisa a war map of the Seven Kingdoms - depicting Robb 's armies concentrated around Riverrun and Harrenhal , Lannister and Tyrell armies overrunning the Stormlands , Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King 's Landing , and Greyjoy forces occupying the western coasts of the North .
Lannisters,'Littlefinger ' Petyr Baelish , and Grand Maester Pycelle are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and Eddard 's actions against the Lannisters , but Eddard wants to see justice done .
Lannisters,Aerys opened the city gates , and the Lannisters proceeded to sack the city .
Lannisters,After hearing her news , he vows to find the truth and expose the Lannisters to Robert .
Lannisters,Arya enjoys the spectacle of the actors re-enacting the War of the Five Kings , playing Baratheons and Lannisters , but her pleasure ceases when her father , and his execution , are inaccurately caricatured .
Lannisters,As Eddard watches them practice , his pleasure at seeing Arya happy sours when he realizes that a conflict between the Starks and Lannisters may be inevitable ; his daughter may well be training herself for war .
Lannisters,Baelish confesses that while his friendship with the Lannisters was fruitful , it is best to keep enemies confused and his absence from the wedding means that he will never be suspected .
Lannisters,Bolton concedes that some of the Lannister officers might have useful information they could be tortured into revealing , but Robb refuses , not wanting to give the Lannisters an excuse to torture his sisters , Sansa and Arya .
Lannisters,Bolton expresses his concern that Brynden Tully escaped the massacre , but Walder dismisses his worries , pointing out that the Blackfish - and the remaining Tully garrison at Riverrun - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the Lannisters , Boltons , and Freys , although Bolton is still visibly concerned .
Lannisters,Cersei flatly refuses , but Tywin is insistent : the marriages of Cersei and Tyrion will place the North and the Reach firmly in the Lannisters ' control .
Lannisters,Discouraged , he moves on to present Tyrion 's offer that the Lannisters want to make a prisoner exchange with the Starks : if they release Jaime Lannister , Queen Cersei will release both Sansa Stark and Arya Stark ( Baelish lies about the Lannisters having Arya ) .
Lannisters,Edmure 's role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the Lannisters back west across the Red Fork of the Trident .
Lannisters,Even though King Robert told him to make peace with the Lannisters , Lord Eddard could not bring himself to let this injustice stand .
Lannisters,Frey will become Lord of Riverrun , and the Freys will replace the Tullys as the Lannisters ' vassals in the Riverlands .
Lannisters,He has been impaled on a lance , shot with an arrow , and at his fifth death the Lannisters hanged him for treason and stuck a dagger in his eye ( which did n't heal when Thoros brought him back ) .
Lannisters,He tries to gain Renly 's trust by implying that if Renly does march on the capital , he will help take down the Lannisters from within ( it is unclear if he is lying , but he is also ready to jump ship if the Lannisters lose , and Stannis is not an option , because Stannis despises Littlefinger ) ; Renly is tempted by the notion , despite his dislike for Littlefinger .
Lannisters,In King 's Landing , Queen Regent Cersei Lannister encounters Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish in a courtyard , and tells him she fears that the Tyrells do not have the Lannisters ' best interests at heart , but her father wo n't listen .
Lannisters,In the letter , Lysa says that Jon Arryn was murdered by the Lannisters and that they plan to conspire against King Robert .
Lannisters,Locke reasons that maiming Tywin 's son will be the ultimate proof that the Lannisters would never deal with Locke , much less bribe him .
Lannisters,Mormont tells Jon that the war between the Lannisters and Starks is less important than what they face now , a renewed threat from the wildlings , White Walkers , and wights .
Lannisters,Now , as the Tully 's army has been defeated and Riverrun is held by the Lannisters , he wants to know why he should be helping Robb and taking up arms against the king .
Lannisters,Podrick thinks that Sansa may be better off at Winterfell now that she is far away from the Lannisters , but Brienne believes that Sansa will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother - the Boltons .
Lannisters,Realizing this is true , Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer : if he leaves the Night 's Watch , Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell , so he can rally the North to Stannis 's side and resume the fight against the Boltons , Freys , and Lannisters .
Lannisters,Robb has won every battle he has ever fought , but the Lannisters finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head-on , so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of Robb 's army .
Lannisters,Roose continues that they need her to rally the north against the Lannisters , if need be , and subtly warns Ramsay that if he fails to recapture her , his unborn brother will become his heir .
Lannisters,Sansa confidently remarks on his fighting ability , and inquires when she and Loras will wed , as per the Tyrell plot to keep her out of the hands of Baelish and/or the Lannisters .
Lannisters,She summons Robb , Theon , Luwin and the castle master at arms , Ser Rodrik Cassel and tells them that she suspects that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran because he might have seen something in the tower .
Lannisters,The Hound immediately accuses Brienne of working for the Lannisters , noticing her Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper , which Brienne admits was given to her by Jaime , frightening Arya into thinking that Brienne is working for the Lannisters .
Lannisters,Theon implores his father to reconsider , claiming that if the Greyjoys attack the North , they face the possibility of total destruction if they lose , but if they ally with the Starks and win , Balon will be crowned King of the Iron Islands and House Greyjoy will be awarded Casterly Rock and essentially the source of the Lannisters ' wealth along with it , but Balon rebuffs Theon and chastises him for becoming loyal to the Starks .
Lannisters,Therefore , even though Tywin admits the Lannisters can trust nobody except themselves , they need the Tyrells ' wealth and resources on their side .
Lannisters,They have not had a significant victory since the Battle of Oxcross months ago , and the news of the Lannisters ' victory over Stannis and new alliance with the Tyrells piles bad news upon bad news .
Lannisters,They worry that they have no army to march against the Lannisters , but Ellaria tells them that they do n't need one : to start a war , all they need to do is kill Cersei 's daughter Myrcella , currently in Doran 's possession .
Lannisters,This will make the Lannisters lose face , just as Robb did when he lost his home castle of Winterfell , and bring momentum back to his army .
Lannisters,Tyrion promises Sansa that he will not mistreat her , and Sansa agrees there are worse Lannisters she could be wed to .
Lannisters,Tyrion questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match , but Tywin points out that as a plot against them , the Tyrells ' plan is , by definition , a secret , thus the Lannisters ca n't be said to be `` refusing '' them something which they are n't officially trying to do .
Lannisters,Tywin Lannister has the ancestral Stark Valyrian steel greatsword Ice ( held by the Lannisters since Eddard Stark 's execution ) melted down and re-forged into two smaller swords , after which he burns the wolf pelt scabbard the greatsword was held in .
Lannisters,Tywin plans strategic unions for the Lannisters .
Lannisters,When Theon warns his father that he will not defeat the Lannisters , Balon retorts that he has no intention of fighting the Lannisters .
Lannisters,When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon , Bronn tells him that the Lannisters won the battle , but it was a feint .
Lannisters,With Tywin Lannister's death , the pact between the Lannisters and the Boltons is effectively dead .
Last Hearth,That night Bran asks Osha to take Rickon ( who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to Bran or Robb ) to Last Hearth , the home of House Umber , while he , Meera and Jojen head through the Wall in search of the Three-eyed raven .
Laws,The High Sparrow tells her that the Gods ' Laws must be applied to everyone equally .
Leaf,As the wights are closing in on them , Leaf sacrifices herself , using magic to cause a huge explosion , buying the other three enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel .
Leaf,His vision shows Leaf and other Children of the Forest talking amongst themselves , then looking eagerly at a captive bound to the tree .
Leaf,The Hodor in the cave puts Bran 's body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with Leaf and Meera , as Bran 's direwolf Summer is killed attacking the wights .
Leaf,Though Meera questions the point of her presence during Bran 's training , Leaf states that Bran will need her when he leaves the tree .
Leaf,Wights begin to swarm the cave , killing all of the Children of the Forest except for Leaf , as Meera starts yelling at Bran to warg into Hodor .
Lhara,The bouncer Brusco does n't want her in at first but the prostitute Lhara , who is one of Arya 's regular customers , tells him to let her stay , as oysters are held to be an aphrodisiac .
Lhazar,In the wastelands beyond Lhazar , Daenerys wakes up to terrible news from Ser Jorah Mormont .
Lhazar,The Dothraki raid a village in Lhazar , a peaceful country to the south-east of Vaes Dothrak .
Lhazareen,The pair are interrupted by Jorah and Daario , who take the Lhazareen hostage .
Lhazareen,To illustrate her point , the high priestess indicates another of the khaleen , a Lhazareen girl ( Ornela ) taken from her village at the age of twelve .
Liberation of Slaver 's Bay,For the first time in generations , a Targaryen has begun to conquer again , begining the Liberation of Slaver 's Bay .

Little Bird,The `` Little Bird '' Spies
Little Sam,Gilly brings her baby Little Sam for him to hold and cheer him up a little .
Littlefinger,A master manipulator , Littlefinger is clearly suspicious of her motives , but does n't press the matter for the moment .
Littlefinger,A short time later , Littlefinger meets with Sansa , offering her a place on his ship that will take him from the capital to the Vale of Arryn .
Littlefinger,After the meeting , Tyrion , Podrick Payne , and Ser Bronn drop by Littlefinger 's office in his brothel , where he keeps his ledgers .
Littlefinger,Afterwards , Varys finds Littlefinger in the Great Hall staring at the Iron Throne .
Littlefinger,Arya tries to hide her face to prevent Littlefinger from identifying her .
Littlefinger,As Eddard is packing , Littlefinger arrives and offers to take Eddard to the last place Jon Arryn went before he `` fell ill '' .
Littlefinger,As Sansa is taken aboard , she is greeted by Lord Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish .
Littlefinger,As they finish , Loras mentions that he is engaged to be married ... a fact that Olyvar passes on to his real master , Littlefinger , so he can pass the information on to Cersei .
Littlefinger,Bolton , nevertheless , demands to read any messages Littlefinger might send off back to the Capital .
Littlefinger,Brienne mentions her sworn vow to Sansa 's mother Catelyn , while Littlefinger points out how she was accused of murdering Renly Baratheon and how both he and Catelyn are now dead .
Littlefinger,Brienne tells Podrick to get his horse as they attempt to further pursue Sansa and Littlefinger .
Littlefinger,Bronn asks if he thinks Littlefinger has been stealing to obtain the crown 's money , but Tyrion says the problem is more that he 's been borrowing all of it .
Littlefinger,Catelyn Stark and Ser Rodrik arrive at King 's Landing and attempt to sneak into the city , but are spotted by one of Littlefinger 's men .
Littlefinger,Catelyn insists that Robb would never allow the exchange , but Littlefinger tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters .
Littlefinger,Catelyn is angered by the way they 've been treated , but asks Littlefinger for aid in finding the people who tried to have Bran killed .
Littlefinger,Catelyn must flee with a new ally , whilst Littlefinger sees an opportunity in the chaos .
Littlefinger,Cersei and the remainder of the small council , comprised of Grand Maester Pycelle , Varys , and Littlefinger , summon Sansa to inform her that her father has been arrested for treason .
Littlefinger,Eddard asks Littlefinger why Jon Arryn was searching for Robert 's bastards but he says he does n't know , offering the half-hearted guess that maybe Robert suddenly took paternal interest in them .
Littlefinger,Eddard decides that Littlefinger may be more trustworthy than he first thought , but Littlefinger discourages him from thinking that way .
Littlefinger,Eddard meets the council members : Lord Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish , the king 's Master of Coin and a friend of Eddard 's wife from childhood ; Grand Maester Pycelle , the king 's adviser in all matters scientific and academic ; Lord Renly Baratheon , the youngest of the king 's two brothers and Master of Laws ; and Varys , a eunuch and the Master of Whisperers ( the head of the king 's intelligence network ) .
Littlefinger,Either way , Sansa will be Littlefinger 's powerful `` ally '' in the North .
Littlefinger,Elsewhere in the castle , Baelish subtly warns Ramsay against inflicting any harm on Sansa , and discusses the situation with Roose , who is suspicious of Littlefinger 's motives in betraying the Lannisters .
Littlefinger,He arrives to find Littlefinger and Varys waiting for him , along with Commander Janos Slynt and a detachment of the City Watch .
Littlefinger,He is incredulous that Eddard trusted Littlefinger over him , and even more so that he warned Cersei what he was going to do .
Littlefinger,He says that he is extremely worried that Littlefinger is going to try to take control of Sansa Stark : with Robb Stark 's younger brothers presumed dead at Winterfell , and Arya Stark missing and presumed dead for over a year , Sansa is Robb 's only heir .
Littlefinger,He tries to gain Renly 's trust by implying that if Renly does march on the capital , he will help take down the Lannisters from within ( it is unclear if he is lying , but he is also ready to jump ship if the Lannisters lose , and Stannis is not an option , because Stannis despises Littlefinger ) ; Renly is tempted by the notion , despite his dislike for Littlefinger .
Littlefinger,However , Tywin says that Roose can keep it , because the title alone is enough to give Littlefinger the social standing to be a suitor to Lady Lysa Arryn .
Littlefinger,In King 's Landing , Queen Regent Cersei Lannister encounters Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish in a courtyard , and tells him she fears that the Tyrells do not have the Lannisters ' best interests at heart , but her father wo n't listen .
Littlefinger,In King 's Landing , Tyrion asks for his reward , Littlefinger offers Sansa a way out , and Cersei hosts a dinner for the royal family .
Littlefinger,In Littlefinger 's brothel , the Sparrows attack the High Septon as he engages the services of prostitutes dressed as the Seven .
Littlefinger,In one of his brothels , Littlefinger instructs the newly-arrived Ros and another prostitute , Armeca , on how to please their customers and make them happy .
Littlefinger,In private , Sansa is overjoyed to be free , until Littlefinger points out that it will not stop Joffrey from tormenting her ; however , he does assure her that he will help her escape , for the sake of her mother .
Littlefinger,In response , Littlefinger reveals that he already knows about Varys having met with both Eddard and Illyrio just earlier that day , implying he knows of Varys ' allegiances across the Narrow Sea .
Littlefinger,Instead , the City Watch kill Eddard 's bodyguards and Littlefinger holds a knife to his throat , saying , `` I did warn you not to trust me . ''
Littlefinger,Jon points out that they can summon the rest of the minor Houses , such as the Mormonts , Glovers , Cerwyns , and Mazins , to rival their enemies , and Sansa reveals Brynden 's successful retaking of Riverrun , though she claims she learned via one of Ramsay 's ravens in order to stop Jon from pursuing Littlefinger .
Littlefinger,Later on , as Littlefinger and Robin prepare to depart on a tour of the Vale , a raven-haired Sansa accompanies them , in a feathered black dress with a plunging neckline .
Littlefinger,Littlefinger always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere , but in reality the Iron Throne is heavily in debt , and Littlefinger procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks .
Littlefinger,Littlefinger fetches Eddard to meet his wife , but Eddard suspects a trick and pushes Littlefinger up against a wall outside the brothel wanting to know what his game is .
Littlefinger,Loras gives a beautiful flower to Sansa Stark , while Littlefinger and Lord Renly make a wager on who will win with Renly betting on Loras .
Littlefinger,Meanwhile , Ros , who seems to be acting as Littlefinger 's aide , reminisces about the day Sansa was born , when all the bells in Winterfell were rung in celebration .
Littlefinger,Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish arrives at King Renly Baratheon 's camp as a political envoy from King Joffrey Baratheon at King 's Landing .
Littlefinger,Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish arrives at camp and meets with Tywin .
Littlefinger,Pycelle notes that this will make Littlefinger the acting Lord Paramount of the Vale , an even more important position ( Baelish is even wearing a more expensive tunic than usual , laced with gold , to reflect his new status ) .
Littlefinger,Reuniting , Podrick mentions how both Stark girls denied her request for protection , but Brienne retorts by doubting Sansa is safe with Littlefinger .
Littlefinger,Royce comes onto the dark realization that Littlefinger has control over Robin .
Littlefinger,Sansa asks if they have anything to fear from Lord Yohn ; Littlefinger explains that he does n't trust the retainers and soldiers who saw them , and is taking Sansa somewhere the Lannisters will never find her .
Littlefinger,Sansa asks what will happen on the off chance that Stannis gets killed , and Littlefinger explains that marrying Ramsay Bolton now will at least leave Sansa in a position to insinuate herself among the Boltons and help destroy them from within in future plans .
Littlefinger,Sansa denies Brienne 's request and Littlefinger urges that she stay at the inn as the road is not safe , and seeing this as a trap , Brienne escapes with Podrick on the horses they take .
Littlefinger,Sansa notices that Littlefinger is wearing riding clothes , and he explains that he is heading back to King 's Landing , because Cersei sent a letter requesting his presence and it would be best not to make her suspicious by refusing to come .
Littlefinger,Sansa refuses Littlefinger 's offer .
Littlefinger,Shae dresses Sansa Stark in her chambers , and warns Sansa about Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish .
Littlefinger,She asks Shae to look out for Sansa , particularly in regards to Littlefinger .
Littlefinger,She continues , truthfully telling of Lysa 's mental instability , jealousy and death , changing only a few details ( saying Littlefinger only kissed her on the cheek and Lysa threw herself through the Moon Door ) .
Littlefinger,She points out that there will be two feather beds , and Varys realizes Littlefinger would only pay the extra money for someone other than Littlefinger if it was Sansa .
Littlefinger,She then reports on how frequently Littlefinger has visited Sansa Stark , and says she thinks he is obsessed with her , and wants to smuggle her out of the city .
Littlefinger,So Tyrion arranges for two prostitutes from Littlefinger 's brothel , Ros and Daisy , to entertain Joffrey .
Littlefinger,The Boltons greet Sansa and Baelish At Winterfell itself , the Boltons and their households greet Sansa and Littlefinger .
Littlefinger,The other members of the council - Pycelle , Renly , Littlefinger and Varys - all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm .
Littlefinger,Therefore , she asks that Littlefinger use his spies to try to find out what they 're up to , because he has a good working relationship with them after brokering the Lannister-Tyrell alliance .
Littlefinger,They are taken to meet Littlefinger at a brothel he owns , where Lord Varys is also waiting : one of his 'little birds ' told him they were coming .
Littlefinger,They ransack Littlefinger 's brothel , dragging prostitutes like Marei out into the street by their hair .
Littlefinger,They rebuff Littlefinger 's explanations in favor of speaking with the only other witness : his `` niece , '' Alayne .
Littlefinger,Though Littlefinger told Lord Royce that he and Sansa would be traveling to the Fingers , they instead head west .
Littlefinger,Tywin 's daughter Cersei arrives to find the seats are all occupied , but not wanting to play that game and be relegated to a lowly position , she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at Tywin 's right hand , opposite Littlefinger .
Littlefinger,Varys makes a jab at Littlefinger 's recent , titular promotion as Lord of Harrenhal , noting that this makes Roose Bolton the current Lord of Harrenhal in practice if not in name .
Littlefinger,Varys reveals that he knows about Littlefinger 's assistance in Eddard 's investigation of Jon Arryn 's death and reminds Littlefinger of the consequences that may befall him should the Lannisters discover his involvement .
Littlefinger,Varys rolls his eyes at Littlefinger 's naked ambition and lets him pass , content to sit in the second-closest seat ( for now ) .
Littlefinger,Varys visits Ros , who has been secretly spying on Littlefinger for him .
Lives of Four Kings,Tyrion overhears this and looks vexed , but proceeds to approach Joffrey and Podrick Payne , Tyrion 's squire , presents him with the Lives of Four Kings , a book detailing the reigns of four kings by Grand Maester Kaeth .
Loboda,Jon , Tormund , Loboda and Karsi fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships .
Loboda,Noticing them , and realizing the need for dragonglass , Jon and Loboda go to the burning townhall , only to be confronted by a White Walker warrior .
Loboda,Recognizing the sign of approaching White Walkers , Loboda orders the gates of Hardhome to be shut , abandoning many of the Free Folk on the other side to their fate .
Loboda,Some leaders are convinced , such as Karsi and the giant Wun Wun , but others like the Thenn warrior Loboda begin to leave .
Loboda,While Loboda faces the threat , Jon Snow goes for the dragonglass .

Locke,At Harrenhal , Locke presents the captive Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to the Northern castellan , Lord Roose Bolton .
Locke,At first Locke has his men untie Jaime on the pretext of letting him go , but then his men hold him down on a chopping block while Locke grabs a carving knife , threatening to stab Jaime in the eye .
Locke,Brienne says she overheard when he earlier managed to talk Locke out of letting his men gang-rape her , by convincing him that her father will pay Locke her weight in sapphires .
Locke,He succumbs to exhaustion and Locke does n't even bother to punish him this time , just warning him that if he tries that again he 'll cut off his other hand .
Locke,However , Locke refused the offer ; still under the misapprehension that Tarth owns every sapphire mine in Westeros , Locke is convinced Lord Selwyn is trying to cheat him .
Locke,In a surge of effort Jaime manages to steal the sword from one of Locke 's men , but Jaime is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand , much less wield a sword - and he can not fight as well with his left hand as he could his sword-hand .
Locke,In the Riverlands , Jaime Lannister has had his sword-hand cut off by Locke .
Locke,In the aftermath of the battle , four brothers of the Night 's Watch , including Locke , are found to have died , while all the traitors but one are accounted for .
Locke,In the confusion , Locke slips into the tent and attempts to abduct Bran , but Bran wargs into Hodor and uses him to kill Locke .
Locke,Jaime asks if they want to negotiate , but Locke says they 'll have his head if he does n't bring the Kingslayer back to the King in the North , so there 's not much Jaime can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner .
Locke,Jaime can barely move , but Locke viciously kicks him repeatedly .
Locke,Jaime orders Locke to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants , but Locke dismisses the offer , getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of Brienne being torn apart .
Locke,Jaime tries to smooth-talk Locke once again with offers of how his father Tywin will make him extravagantly rich if he lets Jaime go .
Locke,Jaime weakly tries to point out that if he actually dies Locke and his men will be in serious trouble , but Locke simply dismisses this .
Locke,Jon Snow and Grenn are teaching several recruits , including Locke and Olly , how to fight against wildlings .
Locke,Jon leaves the yard and talks with Locke , who pretends he is from the Stormlands and genuinely wants to protect the realm .
Locke,Just then , riders from House Bolton arrive led by a man named Locke .
Locke,Later , Qyburn peels away the crude tourniquet that Locke 's men applied to Jaime , and finds that the stump of his right arm has become badly infected .
Locke,Later that night Locke 's men make camp , and do indeed drag Brienne kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang-rape her .
Locke,Locke reasons that maiming Tywin 's son will be the ultimate proof that the Lannisters would never deal with Locke , much less bribe him .
Locke,Locke tries to stop them from leaving , but Jaime angrily tells him that Lord Bolton cares more about getting him back to King 's Landing alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy , and backed up by Steelshanks and his men , Locke is unable to stop them .
Locke,Much to Thorne and Slynt 's surprise , Grenn , Eddison Tollett and a group of other men join Jon on his mission , including Locke who asks to say his vows if that is required before he goes north of the Wall .
Locke,Oblivious , Locke boasts that Jaime has n't `` lost '' the hand , and points out that he cut it off and hung Jaime 's own hand around his neck .
Locke,One of Locke 's men moves to give him water but instead empties the canteen over Jaime 's head to taunt him .
Locke,Ramsay greets his father and his new step-mother ( as well as privately congratulating Locke for his maiming of the Kingslayer ) .
Locke,Reporting back to Jon Snow and the others , Locke tells them that only 11 traitors are present and most of them are drunk and wo n't prove much of a threat .
Locke,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Locke,Somewhere else in the Riverlands , Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth have been taken captive by Locke and a detachment of men from House Bolton .
Locke,Soon after , Roose Bolton arrives at the Dreadfort accompanied by a detachment of his army , including Locke and Roose 's new wife , Walda Bolton .
Locke,The following day , Locke 's men lead their prisoners Jaime and Brienne of Tarth back to Harrenhal on horseback .
Locke,Tiring of Jaime 's frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the Lannister side , Locke decides to prove that Jaime 's father will never deal with the likes of him .
Locke,Upon arriving at Harrenhal , Jaime is shocked and furious to find Locke and his cronies have thrown Brienne into a bear pit , facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself , as they all mockingly sing The Bear and the Maiden Fair .
Lollys,Bronn is understandably furious about the change of arrangements until Jaime tells him that if he helps rescue Myrcella from Dorne , Bronn will receive a much better girl than Lollys , who has rights to a much better castle .
Lollys,Jaime finds the couple , and reveals to Bronn that Cersei has reneged on her deal and offered Lollys 's hand to Ser Willas Bracken instead .
Lollys,They seem to get on relatively well , but when Lollys reminds Bronn that her older sister will get the castle when their mother dies , he wryly assures her that mean people like her sister usually get what 's coming to them , clearly setting his sights on the castle .
Lollys Stokeworth,Bronn visits Tyrion in the clothes of a lord , having been betrothed to Lollys Stokeworth , by Cersei 's doing .
Lollys Stokeworth,Further north in the Crownlands at Castle Stokeworth , Bronn is spending time with his somewhat vapid betrothed Lollys Stokeworth .

Lommy,Hot Pie and Lommy try to bully Arya into giving up Needle , but she angrily draws the sword , warning that she `` has already killed one fat boy '' and will happily do it again .
Lommy,She echoes what he had said to Lommy just before he killed him , though Polliver still does n't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about .

Lord Walder Frey,Enduring Lord Walder Frey 's insults directed at him and his wife , Robb makes a public apology to Lord Frey 's daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them .
Lord Walder Frey,The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if Robb can win back the allegiance of House Frey , whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from Robb 's army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying Talisa , a political nobody , instead of one of the Lord Walder Frey 's daughters .

Lord of Light,As both men prepare , Thoros of Myr prays to the Lord of Light to judge Sandor for his crimes if he is guilty or give strength to his sword if he is innocent .
Lord of Light,As she curses him , Sandor taunts Arya over how the god prefers him over her dead friend , however they are both interrupted by Beric , who has been revived by the Lord of Light 's power .
Lord of Light,As she explained to Stannis before , she believes that sacrificing Shireen 's life - which contains the power of a king 's blood - will gain the Lord of Light 's favor , who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard .
Lord of Light,Before the fight begins , Beric calls upon the Lord of Light to ignite his sword with flame , using only his blood .
Lord of Light,During the night at Stannis Baratheon 's army camp , Melisandre gazes intently into the flames of her tent 's brazier hoping to receive visions from the Lord of Light .
Lord of Light,He also scoffs at how Dondarrion and many of his men have converted to the Lord of Light religion , of which Thoros is a priest .
Lord of Light,He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her , but she interrupts him and says Melisandre already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the Lord of Light can be a sin .
Lord of Light,He finds her in her chamber , praying over a fire to the Lord of Light : Selyse is a fanatical believer in the Lord of Light religion , far more so than Stannis , and it was indeed Selyse who first invited Melisandre to Dragonstone .
Lord of Light,His son Matthos Seaworth encourages him to learn to read so that he can study the holy texts of the Lord of Light but Davos is happy to put his faith solely in Stannis .
Lord of Light,Indeed , she wept for joy when Melisandre told her of this service she did for the Lord of Light with Stannis , and because the Red Priestess gave him a `` son '' ( of sorts ) which she never could .
Lord of Light,Kinvara says that while the Lord of Light has a plan , the humans following him do occasionally make errors .
Lord of Light,Melisandre begins praying and announces that they offer up the life of this girl to the Lord of Light , and sets the pyre on fire .
Lord of Light,Melisandre insists that the Lord of Light only allows her glimpses and that Stannis can not abandon the war because of a single defeat .
Lord of Light,Melisandre joins them and appears to quite firmly take Stannis 's side , declaring that the Lord of Light does n't care about Shireen 's Greyscale disfigurement , and this does n't change the fact that she has her father 's blood .
Lord of Light,Melisandre proclaims Stannis a champion of the Lord of Light , as he draws a burning sword from one of the statues .
Lord of Light,Melisandre says the Brotherhood has someone the Lord of Light needs , and soon after has her men take Gendry into her custody .
Lord of Light,Nonetheless , Melisandre does speak with Shireen , who heard the death of her uncle from her bedroom window , explaining in gentle yet matter-of-fact terms that the Faith of the Seven and its holy books are lies : Melisandre insists there are only two gods , the Lord of Light and the Great Other , constantly at war .
Lord of Light,On the beach of Dragonstone , Melisandre presides over a public burning ceremony , setting three people chained to stakes ablaze as an offering to the Lord of Light .
Lord of Light,On the island of Dragonstone , King Stannis Baratheon allows his advisor Melisandre to burn statues of the gods of the Faith of the Seven as an offering to her deity the Lord of Light .
Lord of Light,Renly also scoffs at Stannis ' conversion to the religion of the Lord of Light .
Lord of Light,Seizing on whatever hope she still has , however , she says that the Lord of Light brought Jon back for a reason ; that Stannis was not The Prince That Was Promised , but `` someone must be . ''
Lord of Light,Selyse insists aloud to herself that the sacrifice is what the Lord of Light wants .
Lord of Light,She encourages Snow to take her , as the Lord of Light made humans male and female for a reason ; although clearly tempted , Jon refuses , citing his vows , and the fact that Stannis would n't approve ( to which Melisandre suggests they not tell him ) .
Lord of Light,She quips that the Lord of Light told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath , but the joke goes over Selyse 's head .
Lord of Light,She speaks to Thoros in High Valyrian , demanding to know what became of his mission to convert Robert Baratheon to the worship of the Lord of Light .
Lord of Light,Stannis does n't understand , but Melisandre implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king 's blood as an offering to the Lord of Light .
Lord of Light,Stannis orders the burning of the Seven to honor the Lord of Light .
Lord of Light,The deaths of her `` sweet boys '' and failure to produce a male heir deeply affected Selyse , and caused her to zealously embrace the foreign religion of the Lord of Light .
Lord of Light,The priestess seems troubled by his response ( or perhaps by the fact that the Lord of Light looks favorably on causes other than her own ) .
Lord of Light,The royal couple argue over their daughter , Princess Shireen Baratheon ; Selyse believes the girl 's disfigurement is a punishment from the Lord of Light , but Stannis angrily forbids his wife from trying to physically chastise their daughter for her perceived faults .
Lord of Light,Thoros counters that he has no power , he only asks for favors and the Lord of Light sees fit to grant them .
Lord of Light,To cement Selyse 's position as Melisandre 's most devoted follower , the Red Priestess tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the Lord of Light and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on .
Lord of Light,When Arya asks how , Beric points her to Thoros to explain , but he says that he is n't the one who brings Beric back to life , it 's the Lord of Light , and Thoros is just the `` lucky drunk '' who recites the prayers .
Lord of Light,When he asks her if reviving Jon is possible , she admits to having seen it done , but insists that she can not do it , having lost faith in the Lord of Light due to the failure of her predictions regarding Stannis Baratheon to come true .
Lord of Riverrun,Frey will become Lord of Riverrun , and the Freys will replace the Tullys as the Lannisters ' vassals in the Riverlands .
Lord of Winterfell,Ramsay speaks of his thoughts on how they will easily defeat Stannis 's army since their soldiers , unlike Stannis 's , are trained to fight in the snow , and how he 'll one day be the Lord of Winterfell and the Warden of the North .
Lord of Winterfell,Realizing this is true , Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer : if he leaves the Night 's Watch , Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell , so he can rally the North to Stannis 's side and resume the fight against the Boltons , Freys , and Lannisters .
Lord of Winterfell,The Umbers led by Smalljon Umber travel to Winterfell to meet Ramsay Bolton , the new Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North .

Low Valyrian,She addresses them in Low Valyrian , and says that now that they are no longer slaves but free men and they can make their own choices , and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the Unsullied .
Low Valyrian,Upon arriving at Astapor , Daenerys is given a tour of the Unsullied barracks by the Unsullied 's owner , Kraznys mo Nakloz , with his slave girl Missandei translating his Low Valyrian into the Common Tongue of Westeros for Daenerys .
Luwin,As Theon stirs his men to action , Luwin offers some final advice .
Luwin,Bran overhears Luwin and Osha .
Luwin,Eddard , while he would prefer to stay at Winterfell , agrees with Luwin and accepts the offer .
Luwin,However , when Bran gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery , Luwin suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow , of the kind used in mounted combat by the Dothraki , a notion which pleases Bran .

Luwin,They discover the dying Luwin in the godswood .
Luwin,When Luwin tries to intervene , Dagmer stabs him with a spear .
Lyanna,Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it , comparing their love to the old Targaryen practice of marrying brother to sister ; she also admits to having despised Robert ever since their wedding night , when Robert drunkenly stumbled into Cersei 's bed and called her `` Lyanna '' .
Lyanna,Eddard and Robert greet each other warmly , and then Robert demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to Eddard 's deceased sister , Lyanna , much to Queen Cersei 's impatience .
Lyanna,Eddard asks where his sister Lyanna is , but Dayne simply wishes Stark the best in the wars to come .
Lyanna,He also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the hold Lyanna 's memory has on him , and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like .
Lyanna,He tells her that Lyanna 's death left in him a void that seven kingdoms could not fill .
Lyanna,Littlefinger says that he actually saw Lyanna once years ago , and she was as beautiful as everyone says .
Lyanna,Littlefinger wonders how many thousands died because Rhaegar chose Lyanna - to which Sansa says that he chose her , then kidnapped and raped her .
Lyanna,Not long afterwards , Rhaegar made off with Lyanna , sparking off Robert 's Rebellion which overthrew the Targaryen dynasty .
Lyanna,Rhaegar won and the entire crowd erupted in cheers - only to suddenly drop dead silent when Rhaegar rode right past his wife , Elia Martell , to lay the victor 's crown ( made of blue winter roses ) in Lyanna 's lap .
Lyanna,Sansa never knew Lyanna because she died before she was born , but she notes that people say she was beautiful .
Lyanna,Sansa remarks that her father , Eddard Stark , never talked about Lyanna , but she would at times find him down in the crypts lighting candles at her tomb .
Lyanna Mormont,- Lyanna Mormont , ten year old Lady of Bear Island .
Lyanna Stark,Back when he was a boy living with Sansa 's mother 's family , the old Lord Whent of Harrenhal held a massive tournament : every notable figure of the time came from across Westeros : the Mad King , Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen , Robert Baratheon , Lyanna Stark , everyone .
Lyanna Stark,In the crypts Robert offers up his prayers at the tomb of Lyanna Stark , Eddard 's younger sister , whom Robert was betrothed to before she was kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and died shortly after being rescued .
Lyanna Stark,She comes to the tomb and statue of her aunt Lyanna Stark ( and finds the feather token that Robert Baratheon left there years ago when he visited the castle ) .
Lyanna Stark,Their discussion moves to Lyanna Stark , which surprises Robert , as in seventeen years Cersei has never asked about her .
Lys,The uncouth and sexually vulgar Mero makes himself at home , observes that Daenerys looks like a whore he knows in Lys and feels up Missandei , although the surprisingly gracious queen shrugs his insults off .
Lys,They reply no , but Doreah , a former pleasure-girl from Lys , tells her an old story about how there used to be two moons in the sky .
Lysa,A delighted Lysa declares that she will scream so loudly that night that they will be able to hear her across the Narrow Sea .
Lysa,At some point , before or after this event , Sandor Clegane and Arya Stark arrive at the Bloody Gate of the Eyrie and are informed of Lysa 's death by Ser Donnel Waynwood .
Lysa,At the Eyrie , Catelyn is furious with Lysa : first for Lysa not immediately notifying her about Eddard 's arrest and second for refusing to consider summoning the knights of the Vale to war .
Lysa,At this Lysa does object , as Jaime is not present and she does not want to wait .
Lysa,Baelish has been attempting to spin the death as a suicide , but the lords do n't believe him , given Lysa 's devotion to her son .
Lysa,Despite setting in motion this chain of events with her letter to her sister regarding the murder of Jon Arryn , Lysa does not believe that war is in the Vale 's best interests and rather want the knights to stay in the Vale to protect her son and their Lord .
Lysa,Given that Lysa 's son is a young boy and would n't make a good judge in a formal trial , Tyrion instead demands a trial by combat , which Lysa also reluctantly agrees is his right .
Lysa,Given that neither Lysa nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat , she asks for a volunteer to be her champion , and Ser Vardis Egen agrees .
Lysa,However , Tyrion uses the opportunity of his audience in front of Lysa 's court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial , and Lysa is shamed into agreeing .
Lysa,In the Eyrie , Catelyn is shocked by her sister Lysa 's paranoia and distrust .
Lysa,In the letter , Lysa says that Jon Arryn was murdered by the Lannisters and that they plan to conspire against King Robert .
Lysa,Later , Sansa is summoned by Lysa , who proceeds to explain the gory details about Moon Door executions .

Lysa,Littlefinger states that they have known each other since childhood , and Lysa has always adored him , and thus she will soon remarry to him .
Lysa,Lysa releases Sansa and embraces Petyr , who assures Lysa that he only ever loved one woman - her sister .
Lysa,Petyr Baelish witnesses the action and assures Sansa that he will deal with Lysa , whom he says should discipline her child more often , anyway .
Lysa,Petyr is unable to deter her , particularly when Lysa reveals that a Septon and witnesses have been waiting outside the main door .
Lysa,Sansa , relieved to be safe at last , indulges herself , though she becomes a little self-conscious when Lysa begins telling stories of Catelyn 's overeating in her youth .
Lysa,She continues , truthfully telling of Lysa 's mental instability , jealousy and death , changing only a few details ( saying Littlefinger only kissed her on the cheek and Lysa threw herself through the Moon Door ) .
Lysa,The instant they leave , Lysa , for unclear reasons , insists on marrying Petyr immediately , claiming that they already had a wedding night many years ago .
Lysa,Tyrion points out that if he is harmed , there will be war with House Lannister , but Lysa is unconcerned about his threats , as the Vale is strongly-defended and the Eyrie is impregnable .
Lysa,Unknown to the pair , the kiss is seen by Lysa .
Lysa Arryn,Brienne implores Arya to come with her to safety , causing the Hound to mock Brienne , pointing out that there is no `` safety '' for Arya anymore : her aunt Lysa Arryn in the Eyrie - whom Brienne and Podrick are seeking out - is dead , as are her father , mother , and older brother , while the Stark armies are scattered and Winterfell is a smoking ruin .
Lysa Arryn,Having memorized the complex family trees of the Great Houses , Podrick surmises that Arya 's aunt Lysa Arryn is the Hound 's only remaining chance of a reward for her .
Lysa Arryn,In the Vale , Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne are heading towards the Bloody Gate when they happen upon Arya Stark practicing her water dancing while Sandor Clegane is off relieving himself , both returning from the Eyrie after receiving words of Lysa Arryn 's death .
Lysa Arryn,The Hound reminds her that she still has an aunt in the Vale , Lysa Arryn , to whom he plans to ransom Arya .
Lysa Arryn,The lords are suspicious of Lysa Arryn 's death , which occured so soon after her marriage .
Lysa Arryn,Upon arriving at the Eyrie itself , Sansa tries to slip into her alias , but Lysa Arryn tells her not to bother around her own flesh and blood .
Lysa Tully,Meanwhile , Arya Stark and the Hound , crossing the Riverlands , are spotted by a farmer and his young daughter while making their way to the Vale where Arya can be ransomed to her `` rich '' aunt , Lysa Tully .
Lysene,On Dragonstone , Davos recruits the Lysene sellsail Salladhor Saan and his fleet of thirty ships to King Stannis Baratheon 's cause .
M'Lord,Tywin later suspects that Arya is highborn , because she does n't pronounce `` M'Lord '' the way commoners do , instead saying `` My Lord , '' and possesses an educated vocabulary .
Mace,After visiting the Iron Bank building , Meryn and a few other Lannister guards depart from Mace at night and go to visit a local brothel .
Mace,Although Mace preens at his new responsibilities , Pycelle is outraged at Qyburn 's promotion ( as he was thrown out of the order of Maesters for conducting human experimentation ) .
Mace,Arya abandons her mission to assassinate the Thin Man , and instead follows Ser Meryn as he accompanies Mace .
Mace,Cersei , Jaime and Ser Gregor enter the room , startling Pycelle and Mace .
Mace,Instead , she says that they will send Mace himself to Braavos to negotiate for more time , because sending such a high-ranking official will show the bank how seriously they take their large debts .
Mace,Lady Olenna is a cunning and intelligent woman who speaks her mind , and bluntly says that her son Mace was a fool for supporting Renly Baratheon 's claim to the throne , though Margaery speaks well of Renly .
Mace,Sansa is worried that this means the Tyrells will cancel their proposed marriage alliance ( meaning Sansa will be stuck with Joffrey again ) , but Olenna assures her that her son Mace is too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything .
Mace,The Tyrells ( Margaery , Olenna , Mace , and Loras ) , as well as Varys , Prince Oberyn , Tywin , Tyrion , and Sansa Stark , make little effort to hide their disgust .
Mace Tyrell,At the breakfast celebration , Mace Tyrell gifts Joffrey a magnificent golden chalice with seven facets , one for each of the major houses in the Seven Kingdoms and wishes he and his daughter , Margaery Tyrell , a long and happy marriage .
Mace Tyrell,Tommen has apparently also decided to make Mace Tyrell the new Master of Coin in addition to his duties as Master of Ships , and extends the ( just now made up ) position of `` Master of War '' to Kevan Lannister .
Mad King,After the rest leave , Ser Barristan tells her about her father , and confirms that , contrary to what Viserys told her , the Mad King was indeed quite mad , citing how his crimes against House Stark ultimately led to the rebellion that all but destroyed the Targaryen dynasty .
Mad King,As they walk , Tyrion asks why Jorah would support Daenerys Targaryen and how she would be better than any other rulers , or why Westeros would even support her , given that her father was the Mad King .
Mad King,Back when he was a boy living with Sansa 's mother 's family , the old Lord Whent of Harrenhal held a massive tournament : every notable figure of the time came from across Westeros : the Mad King , Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen , Robert Baratheon , Lyanna Stark , everyone .
Mad King,Barristan Selmy tells Daenarys the truth about her father , the Mad King .
Mad King,Jaime again begged Aerys to surrender , but the Mad King ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin 's head , and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze , burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire .
Mad King,Jaime goes on to say that he killed the pyromancer first , then drove his sword into Aerys 's back as the Mad King tried to run for his life .
Mad King,Jaime is still unhappy that Eddard judged him dishonorable for killing the Mad King , the murderer of Eddard 's father and brother .
Mad King,Jaime responds that he has probably killed thousands , but he saved half a million lives when he killed the Mad King to save the population of King 's Landing , much to Qyburn 's surprise .
Mad King,Jaime then goes on to recall the Mad King's obsession with wildfire , how Aerys enjoyed watching people being burned alive .
Mad King,Jaime warned Aerys that his father was never a man to choose the losing side , that this must be a trick and he should surrender the city while he still could , but the Mad King refused to listen .
Mad King,Now completely enraged , Joffrey bellows that as king , he can do whatever he pleases , but Tyrion again coldly counters that the Mad King thought he could do as he pleased too , which led to him being overthrown and killed .
Mad King,Prince Joffrey 's bodyguard , Sandor Clegane , known as `` the Hound , '' a man with half his face burned in a mysterious accident , introduces Sansa to Ser Ilyn Payne , the king 's headsman , a frightening-looking man who had his tongue torn out on the orders of the Mad King many years ago .
Mad King,Pycelle admits that Ser Gerold Hightower once sat on the council , but dismisses this due to the Mad King 's eccentricities .
Mad King,Shaken at the memory , Jaime speculates that King Aerys did n't believe he would die in the blaze ; in his lunacy , the Mad King believed he would be reborn as a dragon in the fire , granting him the power to burn his enemies to ashes ... so Jaime finished Aerys off by slitting his throat in order to make sure he died , concluding that Eddard Stark found him at that point .
Mad King,Summoning Jaime Lannister , Robert jokingly questions him about Aerys Targaryen 's death , wondering if the Mad King died begging for mercy , but Jaime rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he 'd been saying since the siege of King 's Landing began : `` Burn them all '' .
Mad King,To Jon 's surprise , Aemon reveals that his full name is Aemon Targaryen , the son of a king , brother to another , the uncle of the Mad King .
Mad King Aerys Targaryen,Barristan laments that he wasted so much of his life defending kings who did n't deserve it ; seventeen years defending Robert , and the Mad King Aerys Targaryen before that .
Maegor 's Holdfast,Queen Regent Cersei Lannister offers protection to the ladies of the court in Maegor 's Holdfast .
Maester,Aemon remarks that he can not make Jon stay or go ; like the Maester , Jon must make the choice himself , and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life .
Maester,Everyone claimed Shireen would die of it sooner or later , and urged Stannis to send her to the ruins of Valyria to live out her days with the `` Stone Men '' before the disease infected the rest of the castle ; Stannis says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer , apothecary and Maester he could to save Shireen .
Maester,Jaime then notices that Qyburn is not a Maester , because he is n't wearing a maester 's chain of office .
Maester,The Maester asks if they should bury her or construct a funeral pyre .
Maester,The next day , Jaime leaves Harrenhal in the company of Qyburn ( who is to accompany Jaime to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his Maester 's chain restored through Lord Tywin 's influence- Jaime jokes that his father will make Qyburn Grand Maester if he grows Jaime a new hand ) and a number of Bolton soldiers under the command of Steelshanks , one of Lord Bolton's captains .
Maester,When their party makes camp , as Qyburn checks Jaime 's stump , Jaime questions how the former Maester lost his chain .
Maester Aemon,Afterward , Sam and Gilly visit Maester Aemon , who is bedridden and dying from old age .
Maester Aemon,At Castle Black , Sam and Gilly meet with Maester Aemon , who is furious at the prospect of Sam having violated his vows .
Maester Aemon,His attempts to plead his case to Maester Aemon ( who has selected Samwell as his own steward ) are met with indifference .
Maester Aemon,It turns out that Sam had been sent to retrieve Jon , who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers , including Maester Aemon , acting Lord Commander Alliser Thorne , First Builder Othell Yarwyck , and the exiled former Lord Commander of the King 's Landing City Watch , Janos Slynt .
Maester Aemon,Janos Slynt points out to Thorne that Jon is well liked and Thorne is not , and when Maester Aemon insists upon an election for a new Lord Commander , Jon is far more likely to succeed Mormont .
Maester Aemon,Jon and several other Sworn Brothers urge Lord Commander Jeor Mormont to burn the bodies , but he refuses , wanting Maester Aemon to examine them..
Maester Aemon,Jon is rewarded for his valor and discovers a dark secret about Maester Aemon .
Maester Aemon,Jon ponders that he should be with him , but Maester Aemon tells him their duty to the Night 's Watch comes first .
Maester Aemon,Later , Tyrion discusses north of the Wall with Jeor Mormont and his chief adviser , the ancient and blind Maester Aemon .
Maester Aemon,Later , at the mess hall , Lord Commander Jon Snow asks Sam about Maester Aemon and it is learned his health is waning and entrusts his care in Sam 's hands .
Maester Aemon,Maester Aemon Sam reads a note from Slaver 's Bay to Maester Aemon updating him on Daenerys 's situation .
Maester Aemon,Meanwhile , Sam is caught reading a book about wildlings by Maester Aemon .
Maester Aemon,Sam praises Daenerys 's courage but Maester Aemon worries about his great-niece 's safety because she is all alone , under siege , and with hardly anyone to guide her , while her `` last relation '' is useless and dying thousands of miles away .
Maester Aemon,The election for the new Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch commences , overseen by Maester Aemon .
Maester Aemon,Tormund asks why blind old Maester Aemon patched up his arrow wounds , and Jon says that Aemon is sworn to heal all wounded men , friend or foe .
Maester Aemon,With a wry smile , Maester Aemon casts his own vote for Jon Snow .
Maester Caleotte,After settling into his chair , Maester Caleotte brings him a message that Myrcella has died .
Maester Luwin,At Winterfell , Maester Luwin frantically sends off a messenger raven just as a band of raiders from House Greyjoy , led by Theon Greyjoy , take over the undefended castle .

Mance,All the wildlings to burst into laughter ; their society does not bother with such ceremony - and because the man actually is n't Mance , but his lieutenant Tormund Giantsbane .
Mance,At the hearing , Jon admits to killing Qhorin Halfhand but says that it was not murder , rather Qhorin wanted Jon to kill him to give Jon credibility with the wildlings in order to get a spy into Mance 's army .
Mance,Davos introduces Stannis as the true king of the Seven Kingdoms , but Mance wryly points out that they are not currently in the Seven Kingdoms .
Mance,Eddison notices the wildling forces are beginning to withdraw into the Haunted Forest , proclaiming that they have stopped them for now , but that the wildlings still outnumber the black brothers 1,000 to 1 and that Mance was simply testing their defenses .
Mance,He leaves the fate of the wildling prisoners in Jon 's hands , allowing Jon to decide whether to execute them or to see if Tormund is more willing to negotiate than Mance .
Mance,He notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that Jon might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself , but that Jon must have known he would die assassinating Mance .
Mance,He replies that he wants to be free , but Mance thinks he just wants to be a hero .
Mance,He suggests sending a small party ahead to neutralize Mance 's lookouts in the Skirling Pass .
Mance,However , Mance calls Jon 's bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending Castle Black , he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the Wall , and they will attack Castle Black 's weak southern side as soon as he gives the order .
Mance,Instead , he says that Mance Rayder intends to attack the Night 's Watch with his army of 100,000 wildlings and gives intelligence on Mance 's plan of attack .
Mance,Jon accepts after Mance assures him that if he 'd wanted to kill Jon , poison would be the last of his methods .
Mance,Jon and Sam are sent to serve as sentries on top of the Wall until Mance arrives .
Mance,Jon confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by Qhorin Halfhand to get Jon to infiltrate Mance 's army , and that Qhorin tricked Mance into trusting Jon by allowing Jon to kill Qhorin himself in a fight .
Mance,Jon eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by wildlings , who bring him before Mance , who notes that he is wearing the black of the Night 's Watch again .
Mance,Jon relay 's Stannis ' offer to Mance .
Mance,Jon relays this message to Mance , but he refuses to bend the knee ; to do so would be to show unforgivable weakness in the eyes of his people .
Mance,Jon responds that Mance could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life , so instead of killing Mance he should be taken prisoner and interrogated .
Mance,Jon reveals he told Mance Rayder that a thousand men armed Castle Black and therefore points out that when Mance reaches Craster 's Keep , Rast and Karl will not hesitate in revealing the truth .
Mance,Jon says that there were three hundred men of the Night 's Watch at the Fist , and asks Mance if Mormont could still be alive .
Mance,Jon then insists the Night 's Watch send a party to Craster 's Keep to kill their traitor brothers before Mance gets to them first .
Mance,Jon then proposes his terms to Mance : Mance is to turn his army around and return home .
Mance,Just as Mance begins to give in and start screaming , an arrow pierces his chest .
Mance,Mance 's guards safely grab Jon during the distraction , and Mance demands to know if the Night 's Watch is attacking them , but Jon admits that it 's just as Mance said : the Night 's Watch does n't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the Wall and attack .
Mance,Mance 's plan is for Tormund 's small band to distract Castle Black by attacking their exposed southern side , at which point Mance 's main army will assault it from the north .
Mance,Mance says he is glad that Jon killed Qhorin , as he had killed many of Mance 's wildlings , though he notes that Qhorin was his brother once , back when he was a member of the Night 's Watch and Qhorin had a whole hand .
Mance,Mance then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out , and Jon informs Mance that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend Grenn .
Mance,Mance then notices that Jon is eyeing a cooking knife , and quickly deduces that Jon came to parley with Mance simply so he could assassinate him .
Mance,Melisandre lights the pyre , and Mance slowly begins to feel the agonizing pain of the fire .
Mance,On the night of his execution , Mance stands before Stannis , and although he can not bend the knee , he offers him luck in the wars to come .
Mance,On top of the Wall , Jon hears the horn blowing and looks north , witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the North , just as Mance had promised .
Mance,Quickly cutting the wildling forces down , Stannis and Davos ride up to Mance , who throws down his weapons in surrender , officially ending the wildlings ' siege of Castle Black .
Mance,Resignedly , Mance says that the Free Folk do not kneel , knowing that Stannis will kill him if he does not .
Mance,Saddened , Mance proposes that they drink a toast to her memory , but Jon is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink .
Mance,Sam promises Gilly wherever she goes next he will go too , but their reunion is cut short by two blows from the horn , indicating that Mance's wildling army has finally begun their assault .
Mance,Stannis proclaims that Eddard was an honorable man , and asks Jon what Ned would have done with Mance .
Mance,Tormund will know that Mance is in position when his army makes a massive signal fire ; Mance boasts that `` I 'm going to make the biggest fire the North has ever seen ! ''
Mance Rayder,After surviving the perilous climb of the Wall , Jon Snow , Ygritte , and the wildlings led by Tormund Giantsbane make their way towards Castle Black to await Mance Rayder's signal to begin the attack on the Night 's Watch .
Mance Rayder,Against all odds , the Night 's Watch have repelled Mance Rayder 's forces for the time being .
Mance Rayder,As they talk , Jon kneels before the man , whom he assumes to be Mance Rayder , and calls him `` Your Grace '' as he would a king south of the Wall .
Mance Rayder,Having not seen Mance Rayder since he was taken prisoner at The Wall , the Wildlings question his whereabouts .
Mance Rayder,He wants Jon to convince Mance Rayder to bend the knee and have the wildlings fight for him ; in exchange , he would set them free and give them their own land within Westeros .
Mance Rayder,Instead , he says that Mance Rayder intends to attack the Night 's Watch with his army of 100,000 wildlings and gives intelligence on Mance 's plan of attack .
Mance Rayder,Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand are marched towards the camp of the King-Beyond-the-Wall , Mance Rayder , as captives of the Lord of Bones .
Mance Rayder,Jon Snow emerges from the outer gate of the Wall and begins trudging north through the aftermath of the previous night 's battle towards Mance Rayder's war camp .
Mance Rayder,Jon discusses with Sam that he has a suicidal solution to end the wildling threat ; he plans to assassinate Mance Rayder , noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the army , and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership .
Mance Rayder,Jon is brought before Mance Rayder , the King Beyond the Wall , while the Night 's Watch survivors retreat south .
Mance Rayder,Jon notes they have a bigger problem ; if Mole 's Town has been destroyed , Castle Black is next , and the few black brothers who remain are outnumbered a thousand to one by Mance Rayder 's army .
Mance Rayder,Jon reveals he told Mance Rayder that a thousand men armed Castle Black and therefore points out that when Mance reaches Craster 's Keep , Rast and Karl will not hesitate in revealing the truth .
Mance Rayder,Speaking to Craster 's wives , Jon warns them that Mance Rayder 's army and worse besides will soon reach their location and offers to take them to safety south of the Wall , but the women refuse , preferring to set out on their own .
Mance Rayder,The Free Folk army of King-Beyond-the-Wall , Mance Rayder , including Jon Snow , arrive at the Fist of the First Men .

Margaery,A who 's who of honored guests turns out for Joffrey and Margaery 's wedding in King 's Landing .
Margaery,As Cersei Lannister passes a large crowd on her way to the Great Sept of Baelor , she is increasingly annoyed as people cheer on Margaery , completely ignoring her .
Margaery,As Margaery is forcefully dragged away , she calls out for Tommen , paralyzed with indecision , while Olenna sadly regards Cersei 's barely contained smug expression .

Margaery,Cersei admonishes Margaery 's boldness and reminds her that her impromptu charity work took place on the same streets where the royal party was assaulted weeks earlier .
Margaery,Cersei leaves the cell , smiling smugly at Margaery .
Margaery,Cersei only knows how to rule through fear , but Margaery knows how to win the love of the people she rules over , a skill Cersei lacks .
Margaery,Cersei then reminds her son about the humiliation that she endured at their hands and exploits Tommen 's love for Margaery .
Margaery,Deducing that this is Margaery 's doing , Cersei pays her a visit , to find Margaery busy gloating about her `` exhausting '' night with the King .
Margaery,During their conversation , Tommen proposes that the Iron Throne not antagonize the Sparrows further in order to avoid endangering Margaery 's life .
Margaery,Greeting her mother-in-law , Margaery now more confident than ever , subtly rubs her queenship in Cersei 's face .
Margaery,Having been somewhat placated by Margaery 's charity , the crowd happily cheers for the pair of them .
Margaery,He does not anticipate that Margaery seems to already know and not to care .
Margaery,He grabs his throat , and Margaery and Olenna exclaim that he is choking and needs help .
Margaery,He points out how this will leave Cersei in King 's Landing , free to harass Margaery .
Margaery,He then questions Margaery , who also denies any knowledge of it .
Margaery,He wants to start a war for Margaery , declaring his love for her to a dumbstruck Cersei .
Margaery,His mother Cersei begins to criticize Margaery , saying that she is only charitable to the poor to build up support for herself , and also saying that she thinks she dresses like a harlot .
Margaery,In the Sept 's cells , Cersei meets with Margaery and brings her food but Margaery refuses , revealing that she knows her mother-in-law is responsible for having her and Loras imprisoned .
Margaery,Jaime then urges the Council to allow the Tyrells to march their army into King 's Landing , crush the Faith Militant , and bring Margaery and Loras back to the Red Keep into Crown custody .
Margaery,Joffrey and Margaery 's wedding ceremony takes place in the Great Sept of Baelor conducted by the High Septon and they are wed in front of gods and men .

Margaery,Joffrey excitedly relates tales of the darker chapters of the Great Sept 's history , to Margaery 's feigned interest and Cersei 's annoyance .
Margaery,Joffrey gives Margaery a tour of the Great Sept of Baelor , where their royal wedding is to be held , as Cersei Lannister and Olenna Tyrell follow .
Margaery,Joffrey hands the goblet to Margaery , who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother Olenna .
Margaery,Joffrey plays along and agrees to wed Margaery .
Margaery,Kevan says that Tommen expressly forbid him to use the Lannister army he commands at the city to make a move against the Great Sept , for fear that the Faith Militant will harm Margaery in retaliation .
Margaery,Lady Olenna insists that Sansa tell her the truth about what Joffrey is like , as he is to marry Margaery .
Margaery,Lady Olenna is a cunning and intelligent woman who speaks her mind , and bluntly says that her son Mace was a fool for supporting Renly Baratheon 's claim to the throne , though Margaery speaks well of Renly .
Margaery,Loras Tyrell asks that Joffrey wed his sister Margaery to unite their houses .
Margaery,Loras has lost the will to continue resisting but Margaery tells him to stay strong because he is the future of House Tyrell .
Margaery,Margaery insists that Olenna can not be certain of Tyrion 's innocence , but Olenna states that Tyrion certainly is innocent and confesses that she would never have let Margaery marry `` that beast . ''
Margaery,Margaery mocks Cersei for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her , going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme , she does n't understand innocence and decency , which Margaery suspects is why Tommen loves her , Margaery , and was willing to send Cersei back to Casterly Rock .
Margaery,Meanwhile , Lady Olenna tells Margaery that she is about to leave for Highgarden .
Margaery,Meanwhile , Margaery is still imprisoned by the Faith , and the High Sparrow comes to visit her .
Margaery,Meanwhile , in the Red Keep , King Tommen rails over his inability to help Margaery .
Margaery,Olyvar also admits that Margaery walked in on them once , but did n't seem surprised .
Margaery,On being questioned about what they are doing at a small council meeting , Cersei replies that she is the Queen , only to be corrected by Olenna that the rightful queen is the one married to the king and that Margaery is the one who fits that description .
Margaery,Prior to the wedding , Margaery Tyrell tries to ingratiate herself to Cersei , commenting they will technically be sisters soon ; Cersei responds by telling Margaery the story behind the `` Rains of Castamere , '' relating how it refers to the destruction of House Reyne of Castamere after their failed rebellion against House Lannister ( inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of Houses Reyne and Tyrell and that the same fate may fall upon House Tyrell if they plot against the Lannisters ) and concludes by threatening to have Margaery strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call Cersei sister again .
Margaery,Sansa and Tyrion attempt to leave the feast , while Margaery serves Joffrey a piece of pie .
Margaery,Sansa is confused , as Queen Cersei wo n't allow her to leave the city , but Margaery wryly points out that Queen Regent Cersei might not want her to , but Queen Margaery would be happy to share Highgarden 's pageantry with a friend ... or a sister .
Margaery,Sansa is skeptical Joffrey will let her go but Margaery is confident he will do it to please her , once she is his wife .
Margaery,Sansa is worried that this means the Tyrells will cancel their proposed marriage alliance ( meaning Sansa will be stuck with Joffrey again ) , but Olenna assures her that her son Mace is too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything .
Margaery,Seeing an opportunity , Margaery manipulates Tommen into thinking that as long as Cersei stays in King 's Landing , she will continue to treat him like a child , watching over him .
Margaery,Ser Kevan Lannister , now Hand of the King - is heading the Council - which now consists of himself , Pycelle , and Lord Mace Tyrell - with Lady Olenna Tyrell in attendance to lobby for Margaery and Loras Tyrell 's release .
Margaery,Ser Loras Tyrell arrives at the door and escorts Sansa to the gardens to meet with Margaery and their grandmother , Lady Olenna Tyrell .
Margaery,She insists that Cersei will turn Tommen against Margaery by the time they marry if Margaery does n't act fast .
Margaery,She mentions the new and prospective marriage between Margaery and the new king , Tommen .
Margaery,She then informs the Council that the High Sparrow has planned to make Margaery do the walk of atonement .
Margaery,Since Margaery bore false witness before the Gods , she is arrested too .
Margaery,That evening , Joffrey and Cersei visit Margaery and her brother Loras Tyrell for a small dinner party .
Margaery,That night , Margaery enters Tommen 's chambers , slipping past the Kingsguard and charming Tommen .
Margaery,The Tyrell army will surround the Great Sept , intimidating the Sparrows into releasing Margaery and Loras , without any blood actually being shed - and by the time Tommen finds out what they 've done he will already be happy with the outcome .
Margaery,The Tyrells ( Margaery , Olenna , Mace , and Loras ) , as well as Varys , Prince Oberyn , Tywin , Tyrion , and Sansa Stark , make little effort to hide their disgust .
Margaery,The pair briefly discuss the legal process that Margaery and Loras will face .
Margaery,Thus distracted , Margaery convinces Joffrey to greet the crowd outside .
Margaery,To maintain control of the situation , she offers to speak with the High Sparrow for him and advocate for Margaery and Loras 's release .
Margaery,Tommen and Margaery are we

Margaery,Varys and Olenna discuss Sansa Meanwhile , Olenna is seated in the gardens with two of Margaery 's cousins .
Margaery,When Joffrey naively defends Margaery and criticizes his mother , Cersei realizes that she is on the verge of being outmaneuvered .
Margaery,When questioned , Margaery says that she was ordered to marry a traitor as her family duty , but Joffrey implies that this still means he must have had sex with her .
Margaery,While Joffrey has previously been easy for Margaery to manipulate , Cersei was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind ; the fact that Margaery was married to his uncle Renly ( and thus , already had sex with another man ) , whom Cersei described as a `` traitor and known degenerate '' .
Margaery,With Cersei out of the picture , both Margaery and Tywin will attempt to get their claws into Tommen , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance .

Meera,Amidst the confusion Jojen is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before Meera can fight it off .
Meera,As Meera and Hodor are preparing to leave they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible , indicating the arrival of the Army of the Dead outside of the cave .
Meera,As Meera begs Jojen to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward , Bran calls out to them , revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that Bran has seen in his visions .
Meera,As Meera continues to yell `` Hold the door ! ''
Meera,At Craster 's Keep , Locke scouts the keep for the party of the Night 's Watch sent to eliminate the traitors holed up there ; in his reconnaissance , Locke finds the hut where Bran Stark , Jojen , Meera and Hodor are being held captive .

Meera,Osha remains distrustful of Meera and Jojen Reed and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go beyond the Wall .
Meera,Present-day Hodor braces himself against the door long enough for Meera to disappear into the snow with Bran 's unconscious body on the sled .
Meera,Some of the deserters amuse themselves by tormenting Hodor , while the others are taken to Karl , who threatens to kill Meera and Jojen .
Meera,That night , Karl enters the prisoners ' hut and attempts to rape Meera , but Jojen distracts Karl when he reveals his possession of greensight and claims to have seen Karl dead before the night is out .
Meera,That night Bran asks Osha to take Rickon ( who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to Bran or Robb ) to Last Hearth , the home of House Umber , while he , Meera and Jojen head through the Wall in search of the Three-eyed raven .
Meera,The Hodor in the cave puts Bran 's body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with Leaf and Meera , as Bran 's direwolf Summer is killed attacking the wights .
Meera,The Three-eyed Raven tells Bran , Meera and Hodor that the Night King is now able to locate Bran and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the White Walkers and the wights out of the cave .
Meera,The mysterious girl calls to Meera and says that Jojen is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live .
Meera,The three-eyed raven identified one of Ned 's companions as Howland Reed , Meera 's father .
Meera,Though Meera questions the point of her presence during Bran 's training , Leaf states that Bran will need her when he leaves the tree .
Meera,Using a dragonglass-tipped spear , Meera kills the first White Walker that enters , and fights alongside the remaining Children of the Forest to try to fend off the wights until Bran wakes up .
Meera,While in the mill , Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall , before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby .
Meera,While still in the vision , Bran hears Meera 's cries to warg into Hodor and the Three-eyed Raven tells him to listen to her .
Meera,Wights begin to swarm the cave , killing all of the Children of the Forest except for Leaf , as Meera starts yelling at Bran to warg into Hodor .
Meera,With some difficulty Hodor pushes the door open and pulls Bran through , coming back to help Meera close the door just as the wights approach .
Meera Reed,Arriving at the abandoned Nightfort , Meera Reed tells Bran , Hodor and Jojen that the castle is safe to enter .
Meera Reed,Bran 's warging is interrupted by Meera Reed , who says that Bran had been gone for hours .
Meera Reed,In the North , tensions rise at camp between Osha and Meera Reed before Bran Stark diffuses the situation .
Meera Reed,Outside the tree , Bran finds Meera Reed , who still appears to be in mourning over her brother 's death .
Meera Reed,The boy introduces himself as Jojen Reed , and his sister as Meera Reed .
Meereen,After confirming to each other that they had not been touched by the stone men , Jorah tells Tyrion that he hopes to find a fishing village and get a boat soon , otherwise they 'll have to walk all the way around Slaver 's Bay to eventually reach Meereen .
Meereen,As Grey Worm is swimming with some other Unsullied outside Meereen , he notices Missandei and a number of other women bathing naked downstream .
Meereen,As Jorah and Tyrion continue their journey to Meereen , and following Jorah 's violent reaction to a previous conversation , Tyrion tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are .
Meereen,As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon , Tyrion deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of Old Valyria , a shorter route to Meereen and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria 's reputation .
Meereen,As Naharis quickly dispatches the Meereen champion , Dany begins her siege of the city by speaking of freedom to the gathered slaves and then catapulting the broken chains of those she has freed across the city walls , demonstrating her previous successes .
Meereen,As Ser Barristan Selmy watches the Unsullied taking the bodies of the crucified masters down outside Meereen , a small boy approaches him , giving him a scroll bearing the seal of the Hand .
Meereen,As they keep walking through the city , Tyrion states that they need to find the leader of the Sons of the Harpy in order to bring peace to Meereen .
Meereen,Brutal fighting rages throughout the streets of Meereen .
Meereen,Daario explains that he has been using the Second Sons as spies throughout Meereen , since they are far less conspicuous than Unsullied and can indulge in the same vices as their informants ; Daario indicates his men 's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall , seriously injuring the man hiding behind it .
Meereen,Daenerys , unsurprised to see them , cancels their plans for escape - they have a slim chance of leaving Vaes Dothrak , let alone getting back to Meereen - and tells them that she has a plan of her own .
Meereen,Daenerys instead opts for rounding up the leaders of each great family in Meereen , including Hizdahr .
Meereen,Daenerys is crestfallen , and says she did not liberate the slaves of Meereen only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy , but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one 's own choices .
Meereen,Daenerys returns to her Unsullied army to resume the march to Meereen .
Meereen,Dany commands him and several Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen disguised as slaves and convince the slaves to rise against their masters .
Meereen,Dany counters that the Second Sons are currently acting as Meereen 's police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him ; Daario dismisses the Second Sons ' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants is n't interested .
Meereen,Dany is pointed to Meereen , the mother of all slave cities .
Meereen,Dany makes a difficult decision in Meereen .
Meereen,Drogon is still recovering from the wounds he received from the arena in Meereen and is uninterested in flying back .
Meereen,Drogon toasting goats On one sunny day outside of Meereen , a goat herder and his son are peacefully tending the goats on a hill while the son throws rocks to pass the time .
Meereen,He expresses confidence that with Missandei 's help , the pair of them should be able to keep Meereen under control until they return with Daenerys .
Meereen,He is subsequently murdered by a member of the Sons of the Harpy , a resistance group operating in Meereen .
Meereen,He looks at Tyrion and then glances in the direction of Meereen , knowing that even if he dies , he needs to get Tyrion to Daenerys .
Meereen,He suggests that she might want to stay in Slaver 's Bay and build a new kingdom for herself in Meereen , complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage .
Meereen,Hizdahr again beseeches Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits of Meereen , because today is the traditional beginning of the fighting season .
Meereen,Hizdahr zo Loraq and Daario Naharis return to Meereen and declare that their mission to Yunkai has been successful , and that the Wise Masters will turn over power to a council of former slaves and former slave owners .
Meereen,Horrified , Daenerys meets with Missandei and Grey Worm in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of Meereen .
Meereen,In Meereen
Meereen,In Meereen , Daenerys Targaryen is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the Great Pyramid , and Ser Barristan Selmy also brings up Rhaegar Targaryen .
Meereen,In Meereen , Daenerys and Daario discuss her impending marriage to Hizdahr zo Loraq .
Meereen,In Meereen , Queen Daenerys Targaryen sits in her throne room where she is receiving the day 's supplicants .
Meereen,In Slaver 's Bay , Daenerys Targaryen marches on the city of Meereen as she begins her siege of the slave city .
Meereen,In their meeting chambers , Yezzan marvels at how Tyrion went from being a nearly-worthless slave to the de facto ruler of Meereen .
Meereen,Jorah is last seen riding from Meereen on a horse .
Meereen,Jorah then departs while Daenerys and Daario Naharis lead the Dothraki horde back to Meereen .
Meereen,Meanwhile , Daenerys finds herself far away from Meereen , atop an impressive hill in a sea of green grass .
Meereen,Meanwhile , Tywin offers to work for the common good with a presumed enemy ; Sam takes stock of the personnel at Castle Black ; the Hound gives another life lesson to Arya ; and Daenerys makes a decision outside the walls of Meereen .
Meereen,Mero gives the slave three coins , one each from Volantis , Meereen , and Braavos , and tells her to randomly give them to the three mercenaries - the one who gets the Braavosi coin will kill the queen .
Meereen,On the road to Meereen , Daenerys speaks with Missandei , who tells her queen that Meereen would be wise to fear her approach .
Meereen,On the western side of Slaver 's Bay , Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont are still making their way to Meereen ( on the far opposite eastern side of the region ) on foot , after losing their boat passing through the Smoking Sea and the ruins of Old Valyria .
Meereen,She also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of Meereen to forge a bond with the people of the city , and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already .
Meereen,She is faced with a champion 's duel where a riding knight of Meereen challenges her to choose a champion that will fight for her .
Meereen,She is irritated to learn that Daario Naharis has captured Meereen 's navy without her explicit orders to do so , but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for Westeros and taking King 's Landing with her 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons .
Meereen,She is therefore resolved to remain in Meereen and `` do what queens do '' : rule .
Meereen,She leaves a very confused Hizdahr to ponder that he will live , and that he will soon be Meereen 's prince consort .
Meereen,She spares his life , however , and gives him a day to leave Meereen .
Meereen,The Unsullied remove the large gold harpy from the top of the Great Pyramid in Meereen to show the Meereenese people they are under Targaryen rule now and their old traditions are gone .
Meereen,The child is dead , her hand pointing the way to Meereen , and Ser Jorah tells Daenerys there is one for each mile to the last of the great slave cities , 163 in total .
Meereen,The cries of the crucified Great Masters reach Dany 's ears atop Meereen 's tallest pyramid , where the city 's emblem , the golden harpy of Ghis , has been draped in the banner of House Targaryen .
Meereen,The goat herder travels to Meereen to visit the queen and lays the charred remains of his flock before Daenerys , hoping to not anger the queen and believes it to be punishment .
Meereen,They fight in front of a reluctant Daenerys , as Hizdahr has convinced her that Meereen 's ruler occasionally makes the rounds to the lower pits ahead of the main tournament .
Meereen,Though not in the circumstances they hoped , Tyrion and Jorah are once again quickly heading towards Meereen and Queen Daenerys .
Meereen,Tyrion , however , manages to successfully persuade him that Jorah is one of the most skilled knights in Westeros , and would fetch a better price being sold to the fighting pits in Meereen , which have just reopened .
Meereen,Tyrion and his entourage are later confronted by a crowd of former slaves in the Meereen throne room .
Meereen,Tyrion generously assumes that this will happen ( which it generally does n't ) , but then he reminds Daenerys that Meereen has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the Great Masters and the smallfolk , and extends this to Westeros and its Great Houses .
Meereen,Varys also informs the council of Daenerys 's conquest of Meereen , and Tywin decides to take measures to prevent her from launching an invasion .
Meereen,Varys and Tyrion walking through Meereen .
Meereen,Varys explains that they are travelling to Meereen by way of Volantis .
Meereen,Varys offers Tyrion the choice of either drinking himself to death in Pentos , or travelling with him to Meereen to support Daenerys Targaryen .
Meereen,When Daenerys asks to be escorted back to Meereen in exchange for the promise of one thousand horses for her safe return , Moro 's wife tells her that she has to remain in the temple of Vaes Dothrak with the other Khals ' widows for the remainder of her days and become a Dosh khaleen .
Meereen,While Grey Worm advocates attacking the cities , Missandei advises against it since that would leave Meereen unprotected .
Meereen,While the rulers of Meereen enjoy a tenuous peace , Tyrion reminds them of the need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys 's blessing , as the Masters could use Tyrion and Varys 's foreign status against them to reclaim Slaver 's Bay .
Meereen,With the city hers , Dany orders the crucifixion of 163 of the so-called `` Great Masters '' in retaliation for the 163 slave children crucified on the road to Meereen .
Meereen,Yezzan takes his fighters to Meereen , to test them in the lower pits and seek out those who are worthy to fight in the Great Pit of Daznak .
Meereenese,While the rulers of Meereen enjoy a tenuous peace , Tyrion reminds them of the need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys 's blessing , as the Masters could use Tyrion and Varys 's foreign status against them to reclaim Slaver 's Bay .
Meereenese Great Masters,After he departs , Hizdahr zo Loraq presents his petition : the right to bury his father 's remains in the Temple of the Graces , as he was one of the Meereenese Great Masters crucified on Daenerys 's orders .
Meereenese Knot,Tyrion and Bronn then lead Pod into another room of the brothel , where Tyrion says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the Battle of the Blackwater : he has paid for Podrick ( who has never had sex with a woman ) to enjoy the services of not one , but three prostitutes : Marei , Genna , and a contortionist named Kayla ( one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a `` Meereenese Knot '' ) .
Meerenese Pit Fighter,During the fight , a Meerenese Pit Fighter is able to lance his opponent in the chest .
Melara,Young Cersei and Melara , in the Prologue flashback

Melisandre,Alone in her bedroom , Melisandre appears despondent and looking as if she has been betrayed or led astray by The Lord of Light .

Melisandre,Arya spots someone behind her target , which is revealed to be Melisandre and a small group of Stannis Baratheon 's men .
Melisandre,As Sam departs , Melisandre enters .
Melisandre,As Tormund inspects Jon 's corpse , Davos visits Melisandre , who has donned her normal glamor but is still gripped by a crisis of faith .
Melisandre,As he views her body , his general reports that Melisandre has fled .
Melisandre,As part of the magical ritual that follows , Stannis throws the leeches into the flames at Melisandre 's direction , and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn : `` The usurper Robb Stark , the usurper Balon Greyjoy , the usurper Joffrey Baratheon . ''
Melisandre,As she leaves Melisandre warns , `` Look to your sins Lord Renly , for the night is dark and full of terrors . ''
Melisandre,As the snow begins to melt , Melisandre is elated .
Melisandre,As they pass by the Red Keep , Melisandre reveals to Gendry that he is King Robert Baratheon 's bastard son .
Melisandre,At Castle Black , a war council is called , and is attended by Sansa , Brienne , Podrick , Jon , Davos , Melisandre , Tormund and Eddison Tollett , who discuss the need for more men to defend Castle Black , since the Karstarks and Umbers , two major Houses in the North , have declared for Ramsay .
Melisandre,At Dragonstone , King Stannis Baratheon speaks with Melisandre as she prepares to depart by boat .
Melisandre,At King Stannis ' command , Ser Davos rows Melisandre to some caves located near Renly 's camp .
Melisandre,At first , Stannis hesitates claiming he has a wife but Melisandre still manages to successfully seduce Stannis .

Melisandre,Coming to the front of the assembly , she sees Melisandre in front of a wooden pyre with a large stake in the middle .
Melisandre,Cressen feigns an apology in an effort to trick Melisandre into sharing a cup of poisoned wine with him .
Melisandre,Davos Seaworth asks whether Melisandre will stay at Castle Black and she replies she will do as Jon Snow , The Prince That Was Promised , commands .
Melisandre,Davos asks Melisandre to leave them alone so Jon can adjust to his revival .
Melisandre,Davos demands proof from Melisandre .
Melisandre,Davos openly calls Melisandre his enemy , condemns her for conducting human sacrifices , and says she is leading Stannis astray .
Melisandre,Davos tries to kill Melisandre
Melisandre,Due to his extreme belief in duty , ( unlike his hedonistic brother Robert ) Stannis is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to Selyse , when he had sex with Melisandre to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly .
Melisandre,During the night at Stannis Baratheon 's army camp , Melisandre gazes intently into the flames of her tent 's brazier hoping to receive visions from the Lord of Light .
Melisandre,Forlorn over the death of his son Matthos , Davos feels that Melisandre has led Stannis to disaster , and is horrified to hear from Salladhor that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices .
Melisandre,He argues with Stannis again about sacrificing the boy , but Stannis is convinced by Melisandre that using Gendry as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the Iron Throne .
Melisandre,He begins to confess to Selyse that he has sinned and shamed her , but she interrupts him and says Melisandre already told her everything - and that no act done in service of the Lord of Light can be a sin .
Melisandre,He believes it is pointless as they intend to sacrifice him , but Melisandre reveals it is merely a sham to keep Gendry feeling secure , in much the same way as keeping a sacrificial lamb from seeing the blade of the knife .
Melisandre,He expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word `` night '' , before hearing the horns that signal Melisandre 's intents to sacrifice Gendry .
Melisandre,He finds Stannis despondent , sitting in the Chamber of the Painted Table alone with Melisandre .
Melisandre,He finds her in her chamber , praying over a fire to the Lord of Light : Selyse is a fanatical believer in the Lord of Light religion , far more so than Stannis , and it was indeed Selyse who first invited Melisandre to Dragonstone .
Melisandre,He rages at Melisandre for not foreseeing his defeat , despite her claims to see the future .
Melisandre,In Gendry 's quarters , Melisandre seduces Gendry long enough to distract him , then promptly ties him to the bed and places leeches on his body .
Melisandre,In the mirror , Melisandre 's reflections shows she has transformed or morphed back to a 400-year-old woman she has been said to be , a frail old woman with sagging breasts , leathery skin and thin wispy white hair .
Melisandre,Indeed , she wept for joy when Melisandre told her of this service she did for the Lord of Light with Stannis , and because the Red Priestess gave him a `` son '' ( of sorts ) which she never could .
Melisandre,Jon Snow 's attempts at training Olly are interrupted by Melisandre , who has been sent to fetch Jon for an audience with Stannis .
Melisandre,Jon looks across the flames and catches the gaze of Melisandre , who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre .
Melisandre,Jon replies he saw nothing , much to Melisandre 's disappointment .
Melisandre,King Renly Baratheon is assassinated by the Shadow brought into the world by Melisandre and fathered by Stannis Baratheon just after agreeing to an alliance with King Robb Stark .
Melisandre,Maester Cressen is outraged at the affront to his gods and fearful that Melisandre is leading Stannis into a war that he can not win .
Melisandre,Nonetheless , Melisandre does speak with Shireen , who heard the death of her uncle from her bedroom window , explaining in gentle yet matter-of-fact terms that the Faith of the Seven and its holy books are lies : Melisandre insists there are only two gods , the Lord of Light and the Great Other , constantly at war .

Melisandre,Queen Selyse speaks to Melisandre , who is enjoying a bath .
Melisandre,Selyse speaks with Melisandre .
Melisandre,Selyse switches tactics and suggests that Melisandre speak to Shireen .
Melisandre,Selyse then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the North but Melisandre is as dismissive about Shireen's '' heresy '' as she always is , and assures Selyse that Shireen will be needed where they are going .
Melisandre,Ser Davos Seaworth challenges King Stannis on his use of Melisandre 's magic and convinces him to leave Melisandre behind when they attack King 's Landing to quash rumors of her influence on him .
Melisandre,Ser Davos pressures Melisandre for news , specifically asking after Shireen , but Melisandre remains silent .
Melisandre,She encourages Snow to take her , as the Lord of Light made humans male and female for a reason ; although clearly tempted , Jon refuses , citing his vows , and the fact that Stannis would n't approve ( to which Melisandre suggests they not tell him ) .
Melisandre,Stannis asks Melisandre if she is sure of their victory at Winterfell .
Melisandre,Stannis does n't protest , but Melisandre does n't look particularly interested in the task .
Melisandre,Stannis does n't understand , but Melisandre implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king 's blood as an offering to the Lord of Light .
Melisandre,Stannis is less than impressed by the sight of the bastard boy who is technically his nephew and is bemused when Melisandre orders him fed , bathed and clothed .
Melisandre,Stannis is skeptical , but Melisandre has him look into a brazier ; Stannis appears to have visions , restoring his faith in the Red Priestess .
Melisandre,Still bitter over the death of King Renly Baratheon , Brienne warns Melisandre that she does not forget or forgive .
Melisandre,The next morning , Stannis 's army , with Stannis and Melisandre at its head , starts its journey to Winterfell .
Melisandre,The shadow wrenches itself free from Melisandre 's womb .
Melisandre,Their conversation is interrupted by Brienne , who recognizes Davos and Melisandre as Stannis ' former entourage .
Melisandre,To Ser Davos he offers a fresh horse and safe passage to ride south or in any direction he wishes , and that he can take Melisandre with him .
Melisandre,To cement Selyse 's position as Melisandre 's most devoted follower , the Red Priestess tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the Lord of Light and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on .
Melisandre,Traveling back from the Riverlands , a ship carrying Melisandre and Gendry leaves King 's Landing and passes through Blackwater Bay .
Melisandre,Tywin counsels the king , and Melisandre reveals a secret to Gendry .
Melisandre,Varys is more skeptical , being suspicious of any practitioners of magic , and points out that Melisandre had already declared Stannis Baratheon to be the Prince , only for him to be defeated twice .
Melisandre,Watching the proceedings , Ser Davos Seaworth holds his tongue , though his disgust both for the ritual and Melisandre are plain .
Melisandre,When Melisandre insists her god is in him , Stannis releases her , realizing she is talking about the creature they created to murder his brother .
Melisandre,When Melisandre points out that he broke his vows once before , Snow acknowledges that he still feels for his deceased love .
Melisandre,When Selyse departs , Melisandre discusses the coming battle to take Winterfell from the Boltons .
Melisandre,When Shireen asks if there is any truth to the Faith 's belief in seven heavens and seven hells , Melisandre replies `` There is only one hell ... the one we live in now '' .
Melisandre,When he asks about Shireen , Melisandre is reluctant to speak .
Melisandre 's God,He asks how Davos can doubt the power of Melisandre 's God when Stannis has seen visions of `` a great battle in the snow '' and Davos saw the creature she gave birth to .
Mero,At the mercenary camp , Mero fondles a Yunkish pleasure-slave while discussing the situation with Prendahl and Daario .
Mero,It swiftly becomes apparent that Daario and Mero do not agree , but Prendahl cuts off their philosophical discussion to call for action over `` the dragon bitch . ''
Mero,Once the sellswords are gone , Daenerys drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at Mero 's back , instructs Barristan that if they must fight the Second Sons , he is to kill Mero first .
Mero,Prendahl and Mero refuse Daenerys ' offer of an alliance , pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the Iron Throne , which is still a distant prospect .
Mero,Shortly thereafter , Daenerys hosts the captains Mero , a Braavosi also known as the Titan 's Bastard , and Prendahl na Ghezn , a Ghiscari .
Mero,Smiling gently she gives them two days to make a decision and sends them off with a barrel of wine Mero had demanded .

Meryn,Arya sells a few and then makes her way to the back chambers where she spies on Meryn from behind some shutters .
Meryn,However , Jaqen H'ghar and the Waif appear and say that Meryn 's life was not hers to take , and that a debt must be paid .
Meryn,Jaime is clearly irked by Joffrey 's arrogance as well as Meryn 's sycophantic agreement with the king 's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed ( Jaime notes that this is more the doing of the Tyrells ) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war .
Meryn,Of the three girls , two begin to cry and scream when they are whipped by Meryn , however the last girl has no reaction when whipped .

Meryn,She brings out her best and most expensive prostitute , a beautiful young woman named Anara , but Meryn again dismisses her as too old .
Meryn,She pulls out a knife and stabs Meryn in both eyes and chest repeatedly , and puts a gag in his mouth to silence his cries .
Meryn,She then reveals her identity and reminds Meryn of how he killed her dance master , Syrio Forel , before calling him 'no one ' and slitting his throat .
Meryn,The brothel 's madam presents several girls in succession to Meryn , but he passes on each as too old .
Meryn,The madam slowly realizes that Meryn is perversely interested in young girls who are barely teenagers - around Arya 's age - so she brings out a very young girl who Meryn accepts gruffly , bluntly saying he expects another `` fresh '' one tomorrow .
Meryn,When Ser Meryn tries to support the king , Tyrion silences the Kingsguard by ordering Bronn to kill Meryn if the knight opens his mouth again .
Meryn Trant,On the road to the Eyrie , Sandor Clegane and Arya Stark continue to spar verbally and physically , particularly when Clegane disparages Arya 's water dancing and insults Syrio Forel for being overcome by a glorified thug like Meryn Trant .

Night 's Watch,Mance immediately counters that the Night 's Watch is low on oil , arrows , and men , and when he sent his full force against the Wall the Night 's Watch threw everything they had at him to repel the attack .
Night 's Watch,Mance is shocked and questions Jon if this is what the Night 's Watch has sunk to : killing a man who let him into his own tent , accepting a parley in good faith , who shared food and drink with him , and who even offered him ( relatively ) reasonable peace terms .
Night 's Watch,Mance orders Tormund to take Jon with him , as Jon knows the layout of Castle Black , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty : if it turns out that he wo n't really betray the Night 's Watch , Tormund can easily throw him off the Wall to his death .
Night 's Watch,Mance says he is glad that Jon killed Qhorin , as he had killed many of Mance 's wildlings , though he notes that Qhorin was his brother once , back when he was a member of the Night 's Watch and Qhorin had a whole hand .
Night 's Watch,Mance then makes his counteroffer : if the Night 's Watch will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the Wall , no more harm will come to the black brothers .

Night 's Watch,Mormont himself is disgusted by Craster 's human sacrifices ( not to mention his incestuous relationships with his own daughters ) , but he will not interfere , and forbids Jon from doing so , as Craster was helped many members of the Night 's Watch , among them , Benjen Stark .
Night 's Watch,Mormont means to lead the Night 's Watch in force into the Haunted Forest to learn more of their foe , to prepare to battle against them , and to find the missing Benjen Stark .
Night 's Watch,Nearby in the Gift , Jon Snow and the wildling party encounter an old man who lives alone at a small farm where he breeds horses for the Night 's Watch .

Night 's Watch,Realizing that Jon is still loyal to the Night 's Watch , Tormund orders his men to kill Jon ; Tormund restrains Ygritte to stop her trying to help Jon , and soon after Jon battles with Orell .
Night 's Watch,Realizing this is true , Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer : if he leaves the Night 's Watch , Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell , so he can rally the North to Stannis 's side and resume the fight against the Boltons , Freys , and Lannisters .
Night 's Watch,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Night 's Watch,Sam brings up that the vows of the Night 's Watch only explicitly forbid members from taking wives or producing children , and that other `` activities '' are open to interpretation .
Night 's Watch,Sam defends himself by reciting the Night 's Watch oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the Wall they are on and repeating Jeor Mormont 's assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians .

Night 's Watch,Sam tells Gilly that they are a considerable distance west of Castle Black , but this is n't a problem , because this means they are close to the Nightfort , the original headquarters of the Night 's Watch , which was abandoned centuries ago as the organization 's numbers dwindled .

North,Balon reveals his plan to attack the lightly defended North while their armies are fighting against House Lannister .
North,Balon tells her that they will continue fighting , but Yara argues that invading the North is pointless since they are unable to hold the strongholds they conquer against the mainland armies and the strongholds in the mainlands are n't really valuable to the Ironborn because they are so far away from the sea .
North,Bran Stark is surprised to meet new allies in the barren North .
North,Cersei flatly refuses , but Tywin is insistent : the marriages of Cersei and Tyrion will place the North and the Reach firmly in the Lannisters ' control .
North,Cersei points out that the North is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders , and a king needs to be more clever .
North,Cersei wants Qyburn to gather information from Dorne , Highgarden , the North and wherever people are trying to take advantage of their losses and plotting against them .
North,Consoling Sansa that she still has allies in the North , she tells Sansa to light a candle in the highest window of the Broken Tower if she ever needs help .
North,Dozens of ravens leaving Winterfell , summoning the banners of the North to war .
North,Drunk with `` victory '' , the Freys gleefully parade the mutilated body around the castle on a horse while mockingly chanting `` King in the North !
North,Either way , Sansa will be Littlefinger 's powerful `` ally '' in the North .
North,Elsewhere , apparently in the North , Theon Greyjoy is being led by the boy who set him free from the dungeon and then rescued him by killing his captors when they tried to recapture him .
North,Furious at Theon 's betrayal , Robb intends to march his army back to the North to repel the invasion .
North,He is apprehended by outriders loyal to House Stark , the wardens of the North , and is taken to Lord Eddard Stark .
North,He says that he is leading Theon to Deepwood Motte , a castle on the west coast of the North which was captured by his sister Yara .
North,He suggests that Cersei 's uncle Kevan Lannister muster a force or have Jaime Lannister lead an army to the North .
North,Here he comes , the King in the North !
North,His demands include the release of his sisters , the return of his father 's remains along with the remains of all those who served him , and the recognition of the North as a free and independent kingdom .
North,However , Tyrion is concerned his mistress is n't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife , a mistress and the entire North despising him .
North,In the North
North,In the North , Bran Stark is having a shared greensight dream with Jojen Reed .
North,In the North , tensions rise at camp between Osha and Meera Reed before Bran Stark diffuses the situation .
North,It also comes out that Tyrion had sex with Ros back in the North , though Tyrion points out it was before he met Shae .
North,Jaime asks if they want to negotiate , but Locke says they 'll have his head if he does n't bring the Kingslayer back to the King in the North , so there 's not much Jaime can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner .
North,Jaime deduces that Brienne is n't from the North because he would have noticed her at Winterfell when he visited there , so ( as she is from House Tarth ) she must be a Baratheon supporter .
North,Jon Umber becomes irritated and questions why the northerners should be told what to do by rulers in the south at all , reminding them that the North was once independent of the other Kingdoms before the Targaryens threatened them with their dragons .
North,Karstark has utterly lost faith in Robb , and says that the King in the North will just give him a scolding , though he should probably call him `` the King Who Lost the North '' after he allowed Winterfell to fall .
North,King in the North !
North,On top of the Wall , Jon hears the horn blowing and looks north , witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the North , just as Mance had promised .
North,Petyr and Robin decide they have to muster the Vale knights to march North and aid Sansa .
North,Ramsay Snow sends Reek , forced to reassume his former identity of Theon Greyjoy , to treat with the ironborn garrison holding the northern fortress of Moat Cailin , barring the armies of House Bolton from returning to the North .
North,Ramsay points out that he eventually got the taxes , but Roose reminds his son that terror can not sustain their hold on the North and that they are outnumbered if the other houses rise up in rebellion .
North,Ramsay reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to House Stark 's rule of the North following Robb Stark 's death , and nearly all the Northerners , who are furious at House Bolton and House Frey 's treachery against the Starks , will rally behind Bran and Rickon rather than Roose if they learn the boys are alive .
North,Ravens bring dark news to the King in the North at Harrenhal ; his brothers are still missing and Hoster Tully has died .
North,Realizing this is true , Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer : if he leaves the Night 's Watch , Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell , so he can rally the North to Stannis 's side and resume the fight against the Boltons , Freys , and Lannisters .
North,Robb refuses to consider the request and sends out ravens , summoning the lords bannermen of the North and their armies to assemble at Winterfell .
North,Robb shows Talisa a war map of the Seven Kingdoms - depicting Robb 's armies concentrated around Riverrun and Harrenhal , Lannister and Tyrell armies overrunning the Stormlands , Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King 's Landing , and Greyjoy forces occupying the western coasts of the North .
North,Roose advises that the few hundred soldiers left scattered in the North can be rallied by his bastard son , Ramsay Snow , who is in the North at the Dreadfort .
North,Roose notes that while he has been named Warden of the North , Tywin Lannister will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn , and he had intended on trading Theon for Moat Cailin , a strategically placed fortress on the border between the North and the Riverlands currently held by Greyjoy forces , preventing the main Bolton army from returning north .
North,Roose then declares that the best way to cement Bolton control of the North is through marriage .
North,Sansa informs him that her family still has allies in the North and tells him to light a candle at the top of the Broken Tower which will signal them that she is in danger .
North,Sansa reminds him of the unborn baby , who , if a boy , will have a stronger claim on the North since he 'll be a true-born .
North,Sansa says that they have to try to retake their home and rescue their brother and that the houses of the North will unite behind Jon as the son of the true Warden of the North .
North,Selyse then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the North but Melisandre is as dismissive about Shireen's '' heresy '' as she always is , and assures Selyse that Shireen will be needed where they are going .
North,She approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the North , but he says that they wo n't go there because these days the North is full of war , cold , and pirates .
North,She reads the letter sent by Ramsay Snow , threatening to flay all ironborn who do not leave the North .
North,Stannis asks how this could happen and Davos insists that the Boltons know the North 's terrain better than they do so it was easy for a raiding party to sneak into camp .
North,Stannis explains that he intends to retake the North from Lord Roose Bolton , but needs an army , and desires the Free Folk to fight for him .
North,Stannis plans to take the Iron Throne and the road to King 's Landing passes through Winterfell , which means that Stannis also intends to take the North .
North,Stannis will then make Sansa the new ruler of the North , as the last ( known ) surviving Stark heir and in memory of her father Eddard 's support for Stannis .
North,Talisa suggests that he lead his army back to the North to repulse the Greyjoys from his homeland and rebuild his powerbase .
North,The War of the Five Kings is not going well for the Starks now , and if Robb were to be defeated and die , the man who controls Sansa controls the North .
North,The message bluntly says that the ironborn have until the full moon to withdraw from the North or receive more bits and pieces of Theon .
North,The note refuses , saying that the Mormonts know only one king , the King in the North , and will only follow a Stark .
North,The other northern bannermen take up the cry and bow before the new King in the North , swearing fealty to Robb .
North,The true war lies in the North , and evil and death are marching on the Wall .
North,Theon Greyjoy murdered Robb 's younger brothers at Winterfell , which makes Sansa Robb 's heir : if he dies , rule of Winterfell and the North goes to her and any man she marries ... which Tywin has no intention of letting the Tyrells get their hands on .
North,Theon at first tells them the simple truth that he wanted to take and hold Winterfell while the North was vunerable to impress his father , then starts frantically lying , saying he hates the Starks and is their enemy , desperately trying to figure out what his captors want him to tell them .
North,Theon implores his father to reconsider , claiming that if the Greyjoys attack the North , they face the possibility of total destruction if they lose , but if they ally with the Starks and win , Balon will be crowned King of the Iron Islands and House Greyjoy will be awarded Casterly Rock and essentially the source of the Lannisters ' wealth along with it , but Balon rebuffs Theon and chastises him for becoming loyal to the Starks .
North,Theon thinks that Robb should prepare the North for war , but Robb is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come , and until then will follow his parents ' orders to remain in Winterfell .
North,Thus if Robb returns to the North , it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the Riverlords who declared for him .
North,To add fuel to the fire , Baelish adds that marrying the last remaining Stark gives the Boltons a stronger hold over the North than an alliance with a hated southern house .
North,To her surprise , Euron admits killing Balon but then defends his actions on the grounds that Balon was leading them to defeat in the North .
North,To her surprise , the servant attending her welcomes her back and quietly assures her that , `` the North remembers . ''
North,Tormund will know that Mance is in position when his army makes a massive signal fire ; Mance boasts that `` I 'm going to make the biggest fire the North has ever seen ! ''
North,Torrhen was the son of Lord Rickard Karstark , one of the major nobles from the North .
North,Tyrion flatly refuses , but Tywin points out that recently he was complaining that he was n't rewarded for his actions in the Battle of the Blackwater , and as heiress to the North , Sansa is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is long past time Tyrion was we
North,Tyrion questions how Sansa is the key to the North , given that her older brother is still alive .
North,Varys tells Eddard that Sansa begged for his life before the whole court and that Robb is leading an army from the North .
North,Walder questions Roose if he intends to rule the North from Winterfell , and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time , after it is rebuilt .
North,Winterfell is too far from the sea , they ca n't successfully defend it with so few soldiers , and the North is rising against him .
North,With the dragons gone , Umber declares there is only one king worthy of his respect and allegiance and bows before Robb , calling out , `` The King in the North ! ''
North,Yara continues to try to convince Balon to end the rebellion , saying the only reason they were able to take strongholds in the North in the first place was because the Northerners were in the south fighting a war , and now that war is over .
North,Yara notes that their invasion is now a definite failure since Deepwood Motte was the last stronghold that the Ironborn held in the North .
North,`` Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North , whose name is Stark . ''
North Robb Stark,The bloody corpses of the two Lannister prisoners are laid out on the floor in front of King in the North Robb Stark in Riverrun 's main meeting room .
Northeners,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Northern,A Lannister scout is captured , and Robb sends him back to warn Lord Tywin that twenty thousand Northern soldiers are marching against him .
Northern,At Harrenhal , Locke presents the captive Jaime Lannister and Brienne of Tarth to the Northern castellan , Lord Roose Bolton .
Northern,He rejects Davos 's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother Renly Baratheon , while Renly is claiming the throne for himself , despite Renly having widespread support , or even with Robb Stark , since while Robb does not seek the Iron Throne , he desires Northern independence , which Stannis sees as Robb `` stealing the Northern half of his kingdom . ''
Northern,King Robb Stark has arrived with the main force of the Northern army , and he helps launch his maternal grandfather 's funeral boat , along with Hoster 's younger brother Brynden `` The Blackfish '' Tully .
Northern,Robb and his forces are further demoralized to find that the Lannisters massacred two hundred Northern and Riverlands prisoners of war before they left , and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies .
Northern,Robb leaves Roose in command of Harrenhal with a detachment of the Northern army while Robb leads his main host back across the Riverlands to Riverrun .
Northern,Roose warns that retreating the entire Northern army group would lose everything they have gained .
Northern,The Northern army under King Robb Stark leads a surprise night-time assault against an encamped Lannister army , which was only manned by Rennick and another Lannister guardsman ( Garden of Bones ) , with his direwolf Grey Wind causing a considerable amount of damage .
Northern,They add that Eddard 's fate may depend on what his son and the other Northern lords do .
Northern,Tywin is upset with the three advisors , noting that between them , they possess the greatest number of spies in the world , yet none of them can locate his son Jaime , even though the entire Northern army has heard of his escape .
Northern,What follows is not a battle but a one-sided massacre as the Northern army is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies .
Northern,While the Northern lords are being slaughtered in the main hall , outside the walls of the castle House Frey soldiers ambush the Stark army in its own camp .
Northern Lords,Then , in front of the Godswood , Reek gives Sansa away to Ramsay ( who actually allows Reek to call himself Theon Greyjoy ) during the wedding ceremony , which is officiated by Roose Bolton and attended by many Northern Lords .
Northerners,Jon tells Stannis that , like the Wildlings , the Northerners will only follow one of their own .
Northerners,Ramsay reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to House Stark 's rule of the North following Robb Stark 's death , and nearly all the Northerners , who are furious at House Bolton and House Frey 's treachery against the Starks , will rally behind Bran and Rickon rather than Roose if they learn the boys are alive .
Northerners,Robb says Tywin Lannister realizes that he 's in such a strong position he does n't even need to attack the Northerners anymore , he just needs to wait , and let their demoralized forces unravel .
Northerners,She reminds Balon that the last time they provoked the Northerners too far they were crushed and her two oldest brothers were killed .
Northmen,The last two of the Targaryen Kingsguard stand before the Tower and block the way of a small party of Northmen led by Eddard Stark himself .
Norvosi,The Norvosi is able to land several blows against Jorah , eventually knocking him to the ground , however Jorah is able to bring out his dagger and eventually bury it into the Norvosi 's chest after a brief melee .
Norvosi,The grand melee begins with six fighters , with Jorah pairing up against a Norvosi long-axe fighter .
Not Theon,Stunned by this admission , Sansa 's anger towards Reek cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone , calling him Theon again , he breaks down and runs out the room , crying , `` Not Theon !

Nymeria,Nymeria offers Trystane the choice of which one of the Sands he 'd like to fight , and he chooses Nymeria , only for Obara to impale him through the back of his head with her spear as he turns his back on her .
Nymeria,Obara and Nymeria arrive on Prince Trystane 's ship , announcing their intention to kill him .
Nymeria,Over the next few weeks the Stark children grow used to their rapidly-growing direwolves : Robb names his Grey Wind , Sansa calls hers Lady , and Arya names hers Nymeria after a great warrior-queen .
Nymeria,When Nymeria can not be found , Cersei spitefully requests that Sansa 's direwolf Lady be killed instead , and Robert acquiesces , upsetting Sansa and angering Arya .
Nymeria Sand,Obara Sand , the eldest , is the daughter of a peasant ; Nymeria Sand ( commonly called `` Nym '' ) is the daughter of an eastern noblewoman ; the youngest of the three , Tyene Sand , is Ellaria 's own daughter .
Oathkeeper,Before departing , Brienne names the sword `` Oathkeeper '' and vows to find Sansa , for the sake of Jaime and Lady Catelyn .
Oathkeeper,The Hound immediately accuses Brienne of working for the Lannisters , noticing her Valyrian steel sword Oathkeeper , which Brienne admits was given to her by Jaime , frightening Arya into thinking that Brienne is working for the Lannisters .
Obara,Bronn fights against Tyene and Nymeria , while Obara attacks Jaime with her spear , driving him away from Myrcella .

Oberyn,As Gregor and his squire make their way to the arena , Ellaria becomes concerned , noting that The Mountain is the biggest man she 's ever seen , but Oberyn remains confident that he will emerge triumphant .
Oberyn,As Jaime and Tyrion exchange a relieved grin across the arena , a furious Oberyn circles the prone Gregor , demanding that before he dies , Gregor confess to murdering Elia and her children , raping Elia , and that it was Tywin who gave the order .
Oberyn,As he evades Gregor , Oberyn repeatedly taunts Gregor by constantly bringing up his part in the murder of his sister , Elia Martell , and her children , and demanding a confession , only enraging Clegane further .
Oberyn,As the fight progresses , Oberyn manages to seriously injure Gregor , stabbing him first in the chest , severing his hamstring and then burying his spear in Gregor 's stomach , pinning him to the floor .
Oberyn,Assigning the reception of the Dornish Lords to the City Watch , Tyrion says they should find Oberyn as soon as possible `` before he kills somebody or several somebodies '' .
Oberyn,Berserk with fury , Gregor grabs Oberyn by the throat and lifts him off the ground , smashing out most of his teeth with a single devastating punch .
Oberyn,Cersei asks Oberyn to take her a gift , a ship , since she missed her last nameday .
Oberyn,Cersei fears for her daughter 's safety in Dorne as Ellaria Sand seeks revenge for Oberyn 's death .
Oberyn,Cersei told Oberyn and his sister that Tyrion killed her mother , and then cruelly assaulted Tyrion until Jaime stopped her .
Oberyn,Climbing on top of Oberyn , Gregor finally admits for all to hear that he raped and killed Elia as he gouges out Oberyn 's eyes with his thumbs before crushing the Viper 's skull between his hands , which he proclaims having done the same to his sister .
Oberyn,Cryptically ( perhaps spurred by Doran ) , she then says that she knows `` your daughter '' Myrcella had no part in what befell Oberyn , and maybe even Jaime is innocent of that ( and indeed he is , as Oberyn volunteered for the trial by combat ) .
Oberyn,Doran insists that for the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne to continue , the engagement of Trystane and Myrcella must stand , and Trystane will simply take his uncle Oberyn 's place on the Small Council .
Oberyn,Doran refuses , reminding her that Oberyn had participated in a trial by combat , and therefore his death was legal , and not murder .
Oberyn,During a childhood visit to Casterly Rock , Cersei showed Tyrion , with great ceremony , to Oberyn and Elia .
Oberyn,Ellaria and Doran discuss Oberyn 's death .
Oberyn,Ellaria helps Doran get to his wheelchair , as they both reminisce about Oberyn , with Doran stating how he envied his late brother for the adventurous life he led .
Oberyn,Ellaria notes how odd it is that she and Oberyn were looked down on for their sexuality in King 's Landing , and Jaime is scorned for his incestuous love for Cersei - to which he remains silent and gives no acknowledgement - though a hundred years ago , if his name were Targaryen , no one would have blinked an eye at such a relationship .
Oberyn,Ellaria sends them out to abduct Myrcella , telling them to do it `` for Oberyn . ''
Oberyn,Ellaria states that Doran would have made a bad adventurer , while Oberyn would have been a bad ruler .
Oberyn,He also offers Oberyn a position on the Small Council , if Oberyn agrees to be the third judge at Tyrion 's trial .
Oberyn,He grows apprehensive to find a helm-less Oberyn drinking , and wearing very light armor - in comparison to his opponent , Ser Gregor Clegane , clad from head to foot in heavy armor and wielding a greatsword .
Oberyn,He wants Gregor Clegane , who murdered Elia , and Tywin , whom Oberyn believes gave the order for Elia and her children to be killed .
Oberyn,Her mother wept , but Oberyn said that , `` we all must choose our battles and the gods let us choose our weapons . ''
Oberyn,However , Oberyn stands too close to his seemingly defeated opponent , and Gregor manages to trip and seize him .
Oberyn,Intending to start his revenge with Gregor Clegane , Oberyn offers his service as Tyrion 's champion in the coming trial by combat .
Oberyn,Later , Tyrion is approached by Oberyn Martell , who tells Tyrion of his disappointment in their first encounter : as children , Oberyn and his sister Elia were told stories of the `` Lannister Monster '' and his extreme deformities .
Oberyn,Obara notes that when she first met Oberyn , he was a man whom she had never met who one day appeared , said he was her father , and that he was taking her away from her mother .
Oberyn,One of the soldiers reaches for his sword , and Oberyn quickly stabs him through the wrist with a dagger and tells the other that his friend will only live if he immediately gets help .
Oberyn,Prince Oberyn and his bastard paramour Ellaria Sand are examining prostitutes in a brothel owned by Petyr Baelish , but currently managed by Olyvar , as Lord Baelish is now in the Vale .
Oberyn,She is upset for a moment , but then Doran explains his solution : his son Trystane will go along with them , to take over the seat on the Small Council which Tywin granted to Oberyn , but which was vacated by his death .
Oberyn,The topic changes to the murder of Oberyn 's sister Elia by Tywin 's `` pet , '' the Mountain , during the Sack of King 's Landing .
Oberyn,They choose the contortionist Marei , and Oberyn orders Olyvar to get undressed also .
Oberyn,Tyrion and Bronn enter , and Oberyn and Tyrion step outside to speak privately .
Oberyn,Tyrion asks Jaime if he thinks Oberyn stands a chance , but Jaime is not optimistic .
Oberyn,Tyrion can not even reply , shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at Oberyn 's skull-crushed corpse , as does Jaime ; the only different reaction is from Cersei , who stares at Oberyn 's slaughtered body , listening to Tyrion 's death sentence while smirking in vindication .
Oberyn,Tywin brings up Oberyn 's knowledge of poisons and the link between that and Joffrey 's death - as some say the King was poisoned - and wonders whether Oberyn had helped Tyrion .
Oberyn,Tywin denies ordering her death , but promises to arrange a meeting between Oberyn and the Mountain so he can have his justice .
Oberyn,Tywin observes that only the Dornish successfully resisted Aegon Targaryen 's dragons during his invasion of Westeros three centuries ago ; Oberyn dryly notes it must be hard for Tywin to admit he needs the Dornish for help .
Oberyn Martell,Later , Tyrion is approached by Oberyn Martell , who tells Tyrion of his disappointment in their first encounter : as children , Oberyn and his sister Elia were told stories of the `` Lannister Monster '' and his extreme deformities .
Oberyn Martell,Meanwhile , elsewhere outside of Sunspear , Ellaria Sand meets with three of the eight Sand Snakes , her lover Oberyn Martell 's bastard daughters .
Oberyn Martell,Pycelle informs Cersei that Oberyn Martell had coated his spear with manticore venom , poisoning Ser Gregor .

Old Valyria,As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon , Tyrion deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of Old Valyria , a shorter route to Meereen and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria 's reputation .
Old Valyria,On the western side of Slaver 's Bay , Tyrion Lannister and Jorah Mormont are still making their way to Meereen ( on the far opposite eastern side of the region ) on foot , after losing their boat passing through the Smoking Sea and the ruins of Old Valyria .

Olenna,Cersei and Olenna in the Great Sept of Baelor .
Olenna,Cersei informs Olenna that the High Septon has called for a preliminary hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit and expresses confidence that Loras will be acquitted .
Olenna,Cersei points out that Olenna 's son Lord Mace Tyrell besieged Storm 's End for almost a full year during Robert 's Rebellion , but Olenna scoffs that her oaf of a son is no warrior and the only thing he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent .
Olenna,He grabs his throat , and Margaery and Olenna exclaim that he is choking and needs help .
Olenna,Jaime suggests that Olenna send House Tyrell 's army to the city instead , and points out to his uncle that Tommen only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying , so Kevan would n't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the Tyrell army arrives .
Olenna,Joffrey hands the goblet to Margaery , who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother Olenna .
Olenna,Lady Olenna insists that Sansa tell her the truth about what Joffrey is like , as he is to marry Margaery .

Olenna,Margaery is even more upset at how ineffectual young Tommen was , so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother Olenna back to the capital to deal with this .
Olenna,On being questioned about what they are doing at a small council meeting , Cersei replies that she is the Queen , only to be corrected by Olenna that the rightful queen is the one married to the king and that Margaery is the one who fits that description .

Ramsay,Elsewhere in the castle , Baelish subtly warns Ramsay against inflicting any harm on Sansa , and discusses the situation with Roose , who is suspicious of Littlefinger 's motives in betraying the Lannisters .
Ramsay,He tells her that Theon Greyjoy tried to escape but Ramsay caught him and tortured him until there was no Theon left .
Ramsay,He then shares the story of Ramsay 's birth ; Roose raped a miller 's wife , who had married without his consent , after hanging her husband .
Ramsay,He trudges through the snow with the candle , up a flight of stairs and into Ramsay 's room .
Ramsay,He wants Ramsay 's help in defeating Stannis , and Ramsay agrees .
Ramsay,However , he refuses to bow to Ramsay ; citing the late Robb Stark 's betrayal at the hands of Roose .
Ramsay,If he succeeds , Roose will give consideration to legitimizing Ramsay as a member of House Bolton .
Ramsay,In Winterfell , Ramsay Bolton and his bedwarmer Myranda discuss Ramsay 's upcoming marriage to Sansa .
Ramsay,In addition any remaining ironborn will be flayed alive - just as Ramsay flayed alive Theon 's twenty ironborn followers at Winterfell after they surrendered , even though he had promised them safe passage .

Ramsay,Reek is about to leave but Ramsay tells him he must stay .
Ramsay,Reek is visibly distraught and begins silently crying himself , as Ramsay proceeds to rape her , and forcefully consummate their marriage .
Ramsay,Reek simply tells her to obey Ramsay or else he would do worse things to her .
Ramsay,Roose Bolton meets with Ramsay afterwards and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of Stannis Baratheon makes him feel like a winner now that they 've lost Sansa .
Ramsay,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Ramsay,Roose explains that his bastard son Ramsay Snow offered Robb Stark 's terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over Theon Greyjoy , but when they did they learned that Ramsay , in his father 's words , `` has his own way of doing things '' ...
Ramsay,Roose gives Ramsay orders as well ; to take Theon and an army to Moat Cailin and reclaim the fortress from the Greyjoys .

Ramsay,Seeing that Ramsay is getting complacent , however , Roose has Walda announce that she is pregnant with a boy .
Ramsay,She also attempts to seduce Ramsay , climbing onto his lap and kissing him , all the while trying to get the knife he had been using to peel apples .
Ramsay,She begs him for help , telling him how she has been locked in her bedchamber since her wedding and is visited by Ramsay every night and he forces himself on her .

Ramsay,Smalljon and Ramsay chat about their experiences with their fathers .
Ramsay,Smalljon then reveals that he has a `` gift '' for Ramsay , who asks if it is a girl , hoping for Sansa Stark .

Ramsay,Theon explains that Ramsay `` broke him into a thousand pieces , '' which Yara affirms `` yes , he sent us one of those pieces '' referring to the box containing Theon 's penis that she and Balon Greyjoy received .
Ramsay,Theon is brought to Roose 's chambers , where Roose is disgusted and angered to learn Ramsay has tortured and flayed Theon ; as Balon Greyjoy 's sole surviving male heir , Theon was a valuable hostage .
Ramsay,Theon refuses to acknowledge the name , twice insisting that he is Theon Greyjoy , but after Ramsay beats him , he finally breaks down and says his name is Reek .
Ramsay,Theon remains under Ramsay 's control .
Ramsay,Tormund says he has 2,000 able fighters , far less than the estimated 5,000 Ramsay has .
Ramsay,When Ramsay asks Smalljon to verify Rickon 's identity , an Umber retainer enters the room carrying the severed head of the direwolf Shaggydog , and Rickon 's expression of dismay confirms this was his pet .

Ramsay Bolton,In the woods , Brienne fills Sansa in on her encounter with Arya , whilst Sansa is reluctant to talk about her experiences under Ramsay Bolton 's tyranny at Winterfell .
Ramsay Bolton,Littlefinger corrects her and clarifies that she will be marrying Ramsay Bolton , then calms her down by convincing her that nobody will look for her there , and suggesting that this is her best opportunity for revenge .
Ramsay Bolton,Royce reminds Baelish that he told him that he was taking Sansa with him to The Fingers , but he received word that she had been married to Ramsay Bolton .
Ramsay Bolton,Sansa asks what will happen on the off chance that Stannis gets killed , and Littlefinger explains that marrying Ramsay Bolton now will at least leave Sansa in a position to insinuate herself among the Boltons and help destroy them from within in future plans .
Ramsay Bolton,Sansa proposes they take Winterfell back from Ramsay Bolton but Jon says he 's done fighting , especially after hanging Olly .

Ramsay Snow,Roose advises that the few hundred soldiers left scattered in the North can be rallied by his bastard son , Ramsay Snow , who is in the North at the Dreadfort .

Rast,Grenn and Edd are shoveling pig-shit , but the former rapist Rast urges them that they are not safe here and can not trust Craster : the man sacrifices his own newborn sons to the White Walkers , and there 's every probability that if the White Walkers do come , he 'll hand over the Night 's Watch survivors to his real masters .

Reek,With much difficulty , Reek finally mutters an apology .
Regent,Littlefinger realizes that even though Lord Eddard has Robert 's edict naming him Regent and Protector of the Realm , he does n't have the men he needs to seize control from Cersei .
Regent Cersei Lannister,Queen Regent Cersei Lannister offers protection to the ladies of the court in Maegor 's Holdfast .
Renly,At King 's Landing , Renly confronts Eddard and offers him a hundred swords to take the queen and her children into custody , but Eddard refuses to dishonor Robert 's last hours by shedding blood in the Red Keep and taking frightened children hostage .
Renly,At King Stannis ' command , Ser Davos rows Melisandre to some caves located near Renly 's camp .
Renly,Brienne says she does n't want to hear his filthy lies , but he says that he knew Renly better than she did , reminding her that both of them spent the last 17 years living in the Red Keep , ever since Robert 's Rebellion when Renly was just a child prancing down the halls .
Renly,Brienne tells Margaery the truth of Renly 's death and vows to one day exact revenge on Stannis Baratheon , whom she holds responsible .
Renly,Catelyn attempts to broker a peace between Stannis and Renly .
Renly,Davos protests this saying that unlike Renly who was a rebel against his rightful king , Gendry is an innocent who has never done him any wrong .
Renly,Hand of the King Tyrion Lannister brings news of Renly 's death to his sister , Queen Regent Cersei Lannister .
Renly,He continues to casually mock Renly which makes Brienne grab him , but he relents and says he does n't particularly care that Renly loved Loras , as he feels people are n't free to choose the ones they love ( which he knows better than most ) .
Renly,He rejects Davos 's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother Renly Baratheon , while Renly is claiming the throne for himself , despite Renly having widespread support , or even with Robb Stark , since while Robb does not seek the Iron Throne , he desires Northern independence , which Stannis sees as Robb `` stealing the Northern half of his kingdom . ''
Renly,He tries to gain Renly 's trust by implying that if Renly does march on the capital , he will help take down the Lannisters from within ( it is unclear if he is lying , but he is also ready to jump ship if the Lannisters lose , and Stannis is not an option , because Stannis despises Littlefinger ) ; Renly is tempted by the notion , despite his dislike for Littlefinger .
Renly,Jaime accurately deduces that she fancied Renly , but points out that Renly was n't attracted to women so much as he was to Loras .
Renly,Jaime insists that Renly 's homosexuality was actually `` the worst kept secret at court '' if she thinks he 's lying .
Renly,King Renly is assassinated .
Renly,King Stannis Baratheon then arrives at Renly 's camp , along with the Red Priestess Melisandre and Ser Davos Seaworth in his retinue .
Renly,Lady Olenna is a cunning and intelligent woman who speaks her mind , and bluntly says that her son Mace was a fool for supporting Renly Baratheon 's claim to the throne , though Margaery speaks well of Renly .
Renly,Loras gives a beautiful flower to Sansa Stark , while Littlefinger and Lord Renly make a wager on who will win with Renly betting on Loras .
Renly,Loras leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover Renly ( riding a mount resembling Loras ) , and Sansa looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother Robb is killed after having his wolf 's head knocked off .
Renly,Loras points out that Joffrey is a monster , that Tommen is only eight and laughs at the notion of Robert and Renly 's other brother , Lord Stannis , ever becoming king , as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster .
Renly,Margaery fails to seduce Renly .
Renly,Margaery is not a naive ingenue like Sansa Stark but versed in court strategies : she honestly believes that Renly is the best candidate for king , and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between Renly and House Tyrell .
Renly,Renly suggests that he could make a good king , but Eddard angrily points out that Stannis is Renly 's older brother and the true heir .
Renly,Ser Loras Tyrell reveals himself as the knight wearing Renly 's armor .
Renly,She also tells them that she executed Stannis after he admitted using blood magic to assassinate Renly .
Renly,She then asks to return to her younger sons at Winterfell but Robb tasks her with seeking an alliance with Renly and sends Ser Rodrik Cassel instead to Winterfell .
Renly,She uses the rumors about Renly 's homosexuality to redirect Joffrey 's anger , stating that Renly always found excuses to avoid sex , but , in one instance , drunkenly suggested `` something that sounded very painful and could not possibly result in children '' , which draws her new fiance 's sympathy .
Renly,She watches Brienne of Tarth defeat Ser Loras Tyrell and claim a place in Renly 's kingsguard .
Renly,Stannis counters that it is odd that Catelyn is standing alongside Renly , given that her own husband Ned Stark rejected Renly 's initial plan to claim the throne and supported Stannis as Robert 's rightful heir , even at the cost of his own life .
Renly,Stannis has come to treat with Renly and give him the chance to willingly relinquish his claim and serve his older brother .
Renly,Stannis says that he wants her , and that he wants Joffrey and Robb dead , and asks her to make `` a son '' again with him ( like the Shadow-creature she conjured to assassinate Renly ) .
Renly,The other members of the council - Pycelle , Renly , Littlefinger and Varys - all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm .
Renly,Their conversation is interrupted by Renly , who informs them that Robert will be joining them at their small council meeting .
Renly,They debate whether to align with Stannis or Renly Baratheon , but there is no agreement as Renly has greater forces , but Stannis is elder and next in line of succession ( if Cersei 's children are discounted ) .
Renly,Tied up back to back on one of the horses , Jaime warns Brienne that when they make camp for the night , they will rape her , more than once , and that his honest advice is to give no resistance , and just think of Renly .
Renly,Tyrion placates him by offering him an opportunity to act as an envoy to Renly and Catelyn .
Renly,Varys tells him that Renly has fled the city , along with Ser Loras Tyrell and a number of retainers .
Renly,While Joffrey has previously been easy for Margaery to manipulate , Cersei was apparently able to plant one seed of doubt in his mind ; the fact that Margaery was married to his uncle Renly ( and thus , already had sex with another man ) , whom Cersei described as a `` traitor and known degenerate '' .
Renly Baratheon,Baelish discusses the assassination of Renly Baratheon , and the subsequent rallying of the noble Houses from the Stormlands under the banner of his older brother Stannis Baratheon .
Renly Baratheon,Brienne mentions her sworn vow to Sansa 's mother Catelyn , while Littlefinger points out how she was accused of murdering Renly Baratheon and how both he and Catelyn are now dead .
Renly Baratheon,He rejects Davos 's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother Renly Baratheon , while Renly is claiming the throne for himself , despite Renly having widespread support , or even with Robb Stark , since while Robb does not seek the Iron Throne , he desires Northern independence , which Stannis sees as Robb `` stealing the Northern half of his kingdom . ''
Renly Baratheon,King Renly Baratheon is assassinated by the Shadow brought into the world by Melisandre and fathered by Stannis Baratheon just after agreeing to an alliance with King Robb Stark .
Renly Baratheon,Lady Olenna is a cunning and intelligent woman who speaks her mind , and bluntly says that her son Mace was a fool for supporting Renly Baratheon 's claim to the throne , though Margaery speaks well of Renly .
Renly Baratheon,Out of a large golden lion , five dwarves ride out , representing Joffrey , Renly Baratheon , Stannis Baratheon , Robb Stark , and Balon Greyjoy , each of the five kings in the War of the Five Kings .
Renly Baratheon,Their cavalry charge is led by a warrior dressed in the armor of Renly Baratheon and it decimates Stannis 's army .
Renly Baratheon,They debate whether to align with Stannis or Renly Baratheon , but there is no agreement as Renly has greater forces , but Stannis is elder and next in line of succession ( if Cersei 's children are discounted ) .
Rennick,The Northern army under King Robb Stark leads a surprise night-time assault against an encamped Lannister army , which was only manned by Rennick and another Lannister guardsman ( Garden of Bones ) , with his direwolf Grey Wind causing a considerable amount of damage .

Rhaegal,Later , she leads her remaining two dragons , Rhaegal and Viserion , into the catacombs , where they are distracted by sheep carcasses .
Rhaegal,Missandei and Grey Worm tell Tyrion that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating ever since Daenerys left .
Rhaegal,The leaders are brought to the catacombs where Rhaegal and Viserion are chained up .
Rhaegar,Barristan accompanied him often to guard him , and says that Rhaegar liked to sing to people .
Rhaegar,Barristan retorts that when her older brother Rhaegar led his army in the Battle of the Trident , men fought and died for Rhaegar because they believed in him , because they loved him - not because they were slave soldiers whose free will had been stripped away .
Rhaegar,Barristan says that Rhaegar was the finest man he ever met , the last dragon .
Rhaegar,Barristan scoffs that Rhaegar was a great warrior but never enjoyed killing , he was a gentle man who enjoyed singing .
Rhaegar,Daenerys grows quiet and says she wishes she 'd known her older brother , but that Rhaegar was not the last dragon ( she is ) .
Rhaegar,Daenerys is surprised , because her brother Viserys only told her that Rhaegar was a great killer .
Rhaegar,Daenerys says his name will be Rhaego , for her brother Rhaegar , slain by the usurper Robert Baratheon .
Rhaegar,Daenerys was born months after Robert Baratheon killed Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident , and only knew her cruel and half-mad brother Viserys , so she asks Ser Barristan if he knew Rhaegar .
Rhaegar,He says that the city 's inhabitants always seem happy from such a distance , but Rhaegar actually liked to leave the Red Keep and mingle with the common people on the streets .
Rhaegar,He tells Eddard that in his dreams he kills Rhaegar every night anew .
Rhaegar,Jorah responds that Rhaegar indeed fought honorably and nobly , but that in the end Rhaegar died .
Rhaegar,Littlefinger wonders how many thousands died because Rhaegar chose Lyanna - to which Sansa says that he chose her , then kidnapped and raped her .
Rhaegar,Not long afterwards , Rhaegar made off with Lyanna , sparking off Robert 's Rebellion which overthrew the Targaryen dynasty .
Rhaegar,Rhaegar won and the entire crowd erupted in cheers - only to suddenly drop dead silent when Rhaegar rode right past his wife , Elia Martell , to lay the victor 's crown ( made of blue winter roses ) in Lyanna 's lap .
Rhaegar,Selmy was a member of the Targaryen Kingsguard and thus knew Rhaegar well : he fought beside him and bled beside him at the Trident .
Rhaegar,Ser Arthur states that Rhaegar ordered them here to guard the tower , so there they remained , even as Rhaegar and Aerys both died .
Rhaegar,She asks what they did with all the money , and Barristan says that they did all sorts of things : sometimes they just gave it to the next minstrel on the road , once Rhaegar gave it all to an orphanage in the slums of Flea Bottom , and one time they spent it to get horribly drunk .
Rhaegar Targaryen,In Meereen , Daenerys Targaryen is looking down on the streets below from her royal apartments in the Great Pyramid , and Ser Barristan Selmy also brings up Rhaegar Targaryen .
Rhaego,Daenerys says his name will be Rhaego , for her brother Rhaegar , slain by the usurper Robert Baratheon .
Rhaego,Her son , Rhaego , is dead .
Rhaego,It is only when the Dothraki are chanting Rhaego 's name , and Drogo lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room , that Viserys realizes they love her .
Rhaego,She finds Drogo and what would have been her infant son Rhaego .
Rhaego,She has now gotten her revenge , not only on Drogo , but on Daenerys ' child Rhaego ; now her `` Stallion Who Mounts the World '' can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents .
Rhaego,They talk about whose dream they are in , and Daenerys silently leaves after touching Rhaego 's hair .
Rhaenyra,Stannis asks who she would have chosen , Rhaenyra or Aegon , and she says she would n't have chosen either - it was all of the choosing sides that plunged Westeros into civil war .
Rhaenyra Targaryen,He asks about her reading , and she explains that `` The Dance of the Dragons '' was a great civil war between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon , each of whom thought they deserved to sit on the Iron Throne .
Rhaenys,Oberyn says he wants revenge for the murder of his niece Rhaenys , his nephew Aegon , and the rape and murder of his sister Elia in the sack of King 's Landing by Lannister troops during Robert 's Rebellion .
Rhaenys,The Brotherhood continues to cite various Lannister crimes : Thoros says he was there during the Sack of King 's Landing and saw the butchered corpses of the royal children , Rhaenys and Aegon Targaryen .
Rickard,Lord Rickard demands Jaime 's execution in revenge , regardless of his protected status as both a prisoner of war and a valuable political hostage .
Rickard,Robb executes Rickard .
Rickard,Robb says that their blood relationship did not stop Rickard from betraying him and wo n't stop Robb from executing him now , but Rickard says it is n't meant to : he wants it to haunt Robb until the day he dies .
Rickard Karstark,He gives the impression that Theon guessed right when Theon says he is the younger brother of Torrhen Karstark , Rickard Karstark's son , and that they are in Karhold .
Rickard Karstark,Lord Rickard Karstark angrily says that this is a waste of time , though Robb points out that Catelyn 's brother and his uncle , Edmure Tully , is now lord of Riverrun and his levies will reinforce their army .
Rickard Karstark,Lord Rickard Karstark fights his way into the room with some of his own men .
Rickard Stark,In the vision , Bran is at Winterfell watching Ned Stark say goodbye to his father , Rickard Stark , before being sent to the Vale as a ward .
Rickon,At dinner , Ramsay is initially well-behaved , toasting his wedding to Sansa , but is soon back to his old ways as he forces Reek to apologize to Sansa for murdering Bran and Rickon .
Rickon,Bran , Rickon , Osha , Hodor , and the direwolves Summer and Shaggydog continue to head north from Winterfell to the Wall .
Rickon,Bran calls his Summer and six-year-old Rickon names his wolf Shaggydog .
Rickon,Dagmer finds some walnut shells , so they know that Bran and Rickon were there , but the hounds ca n't get the scent .
Rickon,Enraged by his dismissive reference seemingly to her brothers as `` those boys '' rather than Bran and Rickon , Sansa vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air , forcing Reek to finally admit that they were not in fact Bran and Rickon , only two farm boys .
Rickon,House Reed are loyal bannermen of House Stark , and they have been searching for Bran and Rickon so that they can protect them .
Rickon,Luwin urges her not to tell Bran and Rickon about the children Theon had murdered , but Bran is sitting up behind a corner and listening to them .
Rickon,Osha and Rickon appear uncomfortable to find themselves in Ramsay 's presence .
Rickon,Osha promises to look after Rickon and orders the Reed siblings to do the same with Bran before she , Rickon , and Shaggydog depart in the dead of night .
Rickon,Ramsay reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to House Stark 's rule of the North following Robb Stark 's death , and nearly all the Northerners , who are furious at House Bolton and House Frey 's treachery against the Starks , will rally behind Bran and Rickon rather than Roose if they learn the boys are alive .
Rickon,Ramsay seemingly falls for it , saying that it took much longer for him to get Theon Greyjoy over to his side but that Theon told him everything , including how Osha had seduced Theon in order to help Rickon and Bran Stark escape Winterfell .
Rickon,Robb says farewell to Bran and to Rickon , who is convinced he 'll see neither Robb nor his parents again .
Rickon,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Rickon,She is horrified at the thought that Bran and Rickon were in danger while she was away and could not protect them , and are now likely dead .
Rickon,She tearfully wonders if her sons Bran and Rickon similarly watched at Winterfell for her return when she failed to arrive to save them .
Rickon,Some time later , Bran , Rickon , Osha and Hodor emerge from their hiding place in Winterfell 's crypts and find the castle burning .
Rickon,Some time later , Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton stating that he has Rickon Stark at Winterfell and if Sansa is not returned , he will slaughter every Wildling at Castle Black , let his men rape Sansa , and feed Jon and Rickon to his dogs .
Rickon,That night Bran asks Osha to take Rickon ( who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to Bran or Robb ) to Last Hearth , the home of House Umber , while he , Meera and Jojen head through the Wall in search of the Three-eyed raven .
Rickon,The boy is surprised , and Theon explains to him that Bran and Rickon escaped , so he had to fake their deaths so he would n't seem weak .
Rickon,There has been no sighting of Bran or Rickon , and though Robb hopes that they are still alive , there is a strong possibility that they are dead .
Rickon,They are then surprised by Shaggydog , Rickon 's direwolf , who leaps out at them from the empty future tomb of Eddard Stark .
Rickon,When Ramsay asks Smalljon to verify Rickon 's identity , an Umber retainer enters the room carrying the severed head of the direwolf Shaggydog , and Rickon 's expression of dismay confirms this was his pet .
Rickon Stark,After ordering Reek to shave him , Ramsay cajoles him into admitting that Bran and Rickon Stark are still alive .
Rickon Stark,At Winterfell , Osha is brought before Ramsay Bolton , who says that while her fellow captive Rickon Stark has value to Ramsay , he is unsure of her worth .
Rickon Stark,At Winterfell , now held by the ironborn , Theon Greyjoy awakens to find that Osha is gone and she has escaped with Hodor , Bran Stark , Rickon Stark and their direwolves .
Rickon Stark,Bran and Rickon Stark are revealed to be alive .
Rickon Stark,Osha frees Bran , Rickon Stark , Hodor , and their direwolves , Summer and Shaggydog , smuggling them out of the castle and killing one of Theon 's guards in the process .
Rickon Stark,Some time later , Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton stating that he has Rickon Stark at Winterfell and if Sansa is not returned , he will slaughter every Wildling at Castle Black , let his men rape Sansa , and feed Jon and Rickon to his dogs .
Rickon Stark,The first turns out to be Osha - the second is Rickon Stark , Ned Stark 's youngest child .
Rickon Stark,Theon even apologizes aloud for having two innocent orphan boys killed , so in desperation he could pass them off as Bran and Rickon Stark .

Riverlands,Over time , however , they began to realize how much suffering was being inflicted on the smallfolk of the Riverlands by Stark and Lannister forces alike , and began to defend the commoners from raiders from both sides of the war .
Riverlands,Robb and his forces are further demoralized to find that the Lannisters massacred two hundred Northern and Riverlands prisoners of war before they left , and the courtyards are choked with piles of bodies .
Riverlands,Roose notes that while he has been named Warden of the North , Tywin Lannister will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn , and he had intended on trading Theon for Moat Cailin , a strategically placed fortress on the border between the North and the Riverlands currently held by Greyjoy forces , preventing the main Bolton army from returning north .
Riverlands,Some time later , Brienne is in Harrenhal 's bathhouse , scrubbing off weeks ' worth of caked on grime and filth from the trek through the Riverlands .

Robb,All of Robb 's advisors tell him this is a bad idea .
Robb,Arya gives Sandor the slip and sneaks past the gate guards , only to witness Frey men kill Stark soldiers and Grey Wind , Robb 's direwolf .

Robb,Edmure insists that they took valuable captives in the battle , Willem and Martyn Lannister , but Robb angrily points out that he did n't stop fighting because his sisters are held captive .
Robb,Edmure tries to at least point out that they lost only two hundred men at Stone Mill and multiple Lannister soldiers died for every man they lost , at which Robb cuts him off and shouts that they need their men more than Tywin Lannister needs his ( who already outnumber the Starks significantly ) .
Robb,Enduring Lord Walder Frey 's insults directed at him and his wife , Robb makes a public apology to Lord Frey 's daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them .
Robb,Eyeing the map with Talisa , Robb decides that if King 's Landing is too strong to attack and he ca n't return home , his only remaining option is to strike where his enemy is weakest .
Robb,First , Robb 's maternal grandfather Hoster Tully has finally died after a long illness at his castle of Riverrun .
Robb,Furious at Theon 's betrayal , Robb intends to march his army back to the North to repel the invasion .
Robb,Having been told of Robb 's death , Jon shares with Samwell Tarly that he had always been jealous of Robb for having more of their father 's affection and for being better than him at riding and fighting , and with girls .
Robb,He also says the only thing he ever resented about Robb Stark is that Robb could effortlessly be the kind of good man that Theon truly wanted to be but had to struggle against his own failings to be like .

Robb,He rejects Davos 's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother Renly Baratheon , while Renly is claiming the throne for himself , despite Renly having widespread support , or even with Robb Stark , since while Robb does not seek the Iron Throne , he desires Northern independence , which Stannis sees as Robb `` stealing the Northern half of his kingdom . ''
Robb,He saddles a horse and prepares to leave to join Robb 's army , ignoring Samwell 's pleas to stay and fulfill his oaths .
Robb,He says that he is extremely worried that Littlefinger is going to try to take control of Sansa Stark : with Robb Stark 's younger brothers presumed dead at Winterfell , and Arya Stark missing and presumed dead for over a year , Sansa is Robb 's only heir .
Robb,However , Robb does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for : Tywin withdrew his garrison to King 's Landing to counter the attack by Stannis , and did n't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle .
Robb,However , the fact that Robb lost his home castle makes him seem vulnerable in the eyes of his bannermen , and many no longer believe in Robb as they once did .
Robb,In frustration , Robb launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of Harrenhal , which Tywin had been using it as the main Lannister forward base in the Riverlands during the first year of the war .
Robb,In response , Robb promises that , after the conflict with the Lannisters , he will oust Greatjon from his keep and hang him for breaking his oaths to House Stark ; when the enraged bannerman goes to draw a weapon , Robb 's direwolf Grey Wind sets upon him , biting off two of his fingers .
Robb,Jaime is captured by Robb 's army .

Robb,Jaime suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and Robb , but Robb refuses and has him imprisoned .
Robb,Joffrey jubilantly explains its meaning that Robb and Catelyn Stark are both dead .
Robb,Jon balks when Samwell hands him a request letter for Roose Bolton , saying he killed his brother Robb .
Robb,Karstark has utterly lost faith in Robb , and says that the King in the North will just give him a scolding , though he should probably call him `` the King Who Lost the North '' after he allowed Winterfell to fall .
Robb,Karstark stands firm , and says the only treason is in letting their enemies go , when in war they should be killing them - if Robb 's father ever taught him that .
Robb,King Robb , Brynden , and Edmure confer in Riverrun 's meeting room .
Robb,Lancel Lannister tells Sansa and the assembled nobles that Robb only won the battle with trickery and sorcery .

Robb,Loras leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover Renly ( riding a mount resembling Loras ) , and Sansa looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother Robb is killed after having his wolf 's head knocked off .
Robb,Lord Karstark asks to speak his mind ( as if he was n't already ) , and says that he thinks Robb lost the war the day he married Talisa , a political nobody , throwing away any opportunity to forge marriage-alliances with badly needed allies , specifically breaking his promise to enter into a marriage-alliance with House Frey .
Robb,Lord Rickard Karstark angrily says that this is a waste of time , though Robb points out that Catelyn 's brother and his uncle , Edmure Tully , is now lord of Riverrun and his levies will reinforce their army .
Robb,Lord Roose Bolton , who is also about to depart Harrenhal for the Twins , under orders from Robb Stark , requests that Jaime pass on his regards to Tywin ; Jaime asks that Bolton do the same for him with Robb .
Robb,Martyn and Willem lie dead before Robb .
Robb,Now , as the Tully 's army has been defeated and Riverrun is held by the Lannisters , he wants to know why he should be helping Robb and taking up arms against the king .
Robb,Obedient to the laws of his father Eddard Stark - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - Robb pronounces the sentence of death and personally beheads Lord Rickard .
Robb,One of them asks if Robb really transforms into a wolf eats the flesh of his enemies .
Robb,Over the next few weeks the Stark children grow used to their rapidly-growing direwolves : Robb names his Grey Wind , Sansa calls hers Lady , and Arya names hers Nymeria after a great warrior-queen .
Robb,Ramsay , knowing how close Theon was to Robb , gleefully taunts him by revealing details of the Red Wedding , particularly relishing the fact that it was Roose who personally murdered Robb .
Robb,Realizing they are in a trap , Catelyn slaps Roose across the face and screams a warning to Robb , but by then it is too late .
Robb,Rickard explains that he was denied his vengeance when Robb 's mother Catelyn set Jaime free in hopes of a prisoner exchange for her daughters in King 's Landing .
Robb,Robb 's forces have won many small but also insignificant minor victories , as the Lannisters are now determined to simply wait Robb out and exhaust his army far from home while they slowly rebuild their own numbers and gain new allies .
Robb,Robb 's strict adherence to justice makes things turn out just as badly as his advisors said they would : the Karstarks withdraw their soldiers from his army and march for home , resulting in Robb losing almost half of his forces which were stationed at Riverrun .
Robb,Robb agrees , but insists that Bolton 's men take Theon alive so Robb can look him in the eyes and ask `` Why ? ''
Robb,Robb has won every battle he has ever fought , but the Lannisters finally realized it was too difficult to try to attack him head-on , so they have shifted to the new strategy of simply fleeing ahead of Robb 's army .
Robb,Robb leaves Roose in command of Harrenhal with a detachment of the Northern army while Robb leads his main host back across the Riverlands to Riverrun .
Robb,Robb says farewell to Bran and to Rickon , who is convinced he 'll see neither Robb nor his parents again .
Robb,Robb says that their blood relationship did not stop Rickard from betraying him and wo n't stop Robb from executing him now , but Rickard says it is n't meant to : he wants it to haunt Robb until the day he dies .
Robb,Robb shows Talisa a war map of the Seven Kingdoms - depicting Robb 's armies concentrated around Riverrun and Harrenhal , Lannister and Tyrell armies overrunning the Stormlands , Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King 's Landing , and Greyjoy forces occupying the western coasts of the North .
Robb,Robb stands and utters , `` Mother '' as Roose Bolton , who had fled the hall when the massacre began , seizes Robb , whispering `` The Lannisters send their regards , '' before stabbing him in the heart .
Robb,Sam takes Jon aside and informs him about Robb leading an army south to war .
Robb,Sansa quietly retorts that Robb might give her Joffrey 's instead .
Robb,Ser Rodrik will go as escort , while Robb will take charge of the castle in her absence .
Robb,She asks Robb to consider exchanging Jaime for his sisters .
Robb,She asserts that the army Robb has gathered should be marching north , not south .
Robb,She begs they take her hostage and that Robb , who merely lingers despondent and heartbroken beside his wife 's corpse , be allowed to leave .
Robb,She predicts that Robb and his betrothed might build a similar love over time .
Robb,She says that she and Robb 's father did n't love each other when they first married , but that he grew to love her over time .
Robb,She summons Robb , Theon , Luwin and the castle master at arms , Ser Rodrik Cassel and tells them that she suspects that the Lannisters tried to kill Bran because he might have seen something in the tower .
Robb,She tells Robb he has no choice but to go to war .
Robb,She then asks to return to her younger sons at Winterfell but Robb tasks her with seeking an alliance with Renly and sends Ser Rodrik Cassel instead to Winterfell .
Robb,Stannis says that he wants her , and that he wants Joffrey and Robb dead , and asks her to make `` a son '' again with him ( like the Shadow-creature she conjured to assassinate Renly ) .
Robb,Suddenly Robb returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner , Jaime himself .
Robb,That night Bran asks Osha to take Rickon ( who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to Bran or Robb ) to Last Hearth , the home of House Umber , while he , Meera and Jojen head through the Wall in search of the Three-eyed raven .
Robb,The Battle of Oxcross is a smashing victory , following through on Robb 's promise to give Cersei `` another Whispering Wood . ''
Robb,The Freys carry Walder Frey 's demands for an alliance , which includes a formal apology from Robb , the castle Harrenhal and all of its lands and incomes , and for Edmure Tully to marry Roslin , one of his daughters .
Robb,The Greatjon roars with laughter and accepts Robb 's commands , much to the shock of Bran , who witnessed the entire incident .
Robb,The Hound is judged by the gods ; Jaime is judged ; Jon proves himself ; Robb is betrayed ; Tyrion learns the cost of weddings .
Robb,The Hound scares Sansa , but tells her to look at him , saying that since the world is made up of killers like Stannis , her father , her brother Robb , and he himself , she better get used to looking at them .
Robb,The War of the Five Kings is not going well for the Starks now , and if Robb were to be defeated and die , the man who controls Sansa controls the North .
Robb,The nurse Talisa Maegyr discusses medical supplies she needs with Robb .
Robb,The only way they can gain enough soldiers to even attempt such an assault is if Robb can win back the allegiance of House Frey , whose thousands of soldiers withdrew from Robb 's army when he broke his promise to make a marriage-alliance with them by marrying Talisa , a political nobody , instead of one of the Lord Walder Frey 's daughters .
Robb,The other northern bannermen take up the cry and bow before the new King in the North , swearing fealty to Robb .
Robb,The woman , who introduces herself as Talisa of Volantis , criticizes Robb for the need for this war .
Robb,Theon Greyjoy murdered Robb 's younger brothers at Winterfell , which makes Sansa Robb 's heir : if he dies , rule of Winterfell and the North goes to her and any man she marries ... which Tywin has no intention of letting the Tyrells get their hands on .
Robb,Theon and Robb outside the Twins .
Robb,Theon considers warning Robb about his father 's actions , but ultimately reaffirms his loyalty to his family by being baptised by a Drowned Priest .
Robb,Theon holds the fort ; Arya calls in her debt with Jaqen ; Robb is betrayed ; Stannis and Davos approach their destination .
Robb,Theon shoots him from behind , angering Robb by endangering Bran .
Robb,Theon thinks that Robb should prepare the North for war , but Robb is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come , and until then will follow his parents ' orders to remain in Winterfell .
Robb,There has been no sighting of Bran or Rickon , and though Robb hopes that they are still alive , there is a strong possibility that they are dead .
Robb,They manipulate Sansa into writing a letter to her brother Robb , asking him to bend the knee peacefully to Joffrey .
Robb,They surround him and recite their oath to the Night 's Watch , and Jon realizes they are right : leaving would make him a deserter and oathbreaker , something his father would never countenance if he were alive , and Jon does n't even know if Robb would accept his help or turn him over to the authorities .
Robb,This puzzles Joffrey , who matter-of-factly states to his mother that he did mean it , and he will have Robb 's head served at his wedding feast .
Robb,This will make the Lannisters lose face , just as Robb did when he lost his home castle of Winterfell , and bring momentum back to his army .
Robb,Thoros says that they plan to bring her to Riverrun to reunite her with her family , and in exchange for a reward from Robb to fund their cause .
Robb,Though he does not know who she really is , Tywin realizes that she is of northern extraction and questions her about her origins and opinions regarding Robb .
Robb,Thus , Robb must try to repair his alliance with House Frey .
Robb,Thus if Robb returns to the North , it will be difficult to rally his men to return south to defend the Riverlords who declared for him .
Robb,To enter the castle would be perilous for Robb , so Catelyn Stark enters to negotiate their crossing the river .
Robb,Two of Eddard 's trueborn sons , 17-year-old Robb and 10-year-old Bran , accompany him to the execution along with his bastard son Jon Snow , his ward , Theon Greyjoy , the master-at-arms Rodrik Cassel and his leading guard Jory Cassel .
Robb,Tyrion is visibly startled by the news , already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause , but Joffrey brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve Robb 's severed head to Sansa at his wedding feast .
Robb,Tywin Lannister hosts a protracted war council to determine a new strategy to deal with Robb .
Robb,Tywin asks what news there is of the war , and Varys reports that Robb has taken the bulk of his army to Riverrun for his grandfather 's funeral , while leaving Lord Roose Bolton in command of Harrenhal .
Robb,Varys tells Eddard that Sansa begged for his life before the whole court and that Robb is leading an army from the North .
Robb,Walder mocks Robb as he limps to his dying wife .
Robb,Walder refuses her , recalling the previous betrayed oath made that Robb would marry his daughter .
Robb,Walder rises to make a toast to Robb , and Catelyn , seated beside Lord Roose Bolton , notices that the latter is wearing mail under his clothing .
Robb,When Robb pays a visit , Bran asks his brother if it is true that his legs are crushed and that he will never walk again .

Robb,With the dragons gone , Umber declares there is only one king worthy of his respect and allegiance and bows before Robb , calling out , `` The King in the North ! ''
Robb,[ 2 ] The next day Robb surveys the battlefield as Silent Sisters tend to both Stark and Lannister wounded , while his bannerman , Lord Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort , argues that they should kill all of the Lannister soldiers they took prisoner , because they 're having trouble supplying their own army and prisoners will slow them down .
Robb Stark,Arya says that their plan was to find her brother Robb , and Robb needs soldiers too , but Gendry points out that he has no attachments to Robb Stark : Arya would be going to her noble-born family , and he 'd just be serving another lord .
Robb Stark,As part of the magical ritual that follows , Stannis throws the leeches into the flames at Melisandre 's direction , and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn : `` The usurper Robb Stark , the usurper Balon Greyjoy , the usurper Joffrey Baratheon . ''

''
Robb Stark,He says that he is extremely worried that Littlefinger is going to try to take control of Sansa Stark : with Robb Stark 's younger brothers presumed dead at Winterfell , and Arya Stark missing and presumed dead for over a year , Sansa is Robb 's only heir .

Robb Stark,Roose explains that his bastard son Ramsay Snow offered Robb Stark 's terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over Theon Greyjoy , but when they did they learned that Ramsay , in his father 's words , `` has his own way of doing things '' ...

Robb Stark,Tywin explains that the desertion of the Karstarks have cost Robb Stark half his army , and ( combined with already being badly outnumbered by the Lannister-Tyrell alliance ) his days are now numbered .
Robb Stark,Tywin states that this will confirm that the Vale of Arryn , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support Robb Stark , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies ( other marriage alliances , with House Tyrell of the Reach and House Martell of Dorne , combined with the crushing of the Baratheons , have in turn secured the rest of southern Westeros under Lannister control ) .

Robert,Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it , comparing their love to the old Targaryen practice of marrying brother to sister ; she also admits to having despised Robert ever since their wedding night , when Robert drunkenly stumbled into Cersei 's bed and called her `` Lyanna '' .

Robert,However , Barristan explains that as a former Kingsguard member under Aerys Targaryen , and one who 'd killed several of Robert 's friends , while Robert did n't mind keeping him in his position as a guard , he never really trusted his advice , so he left him out of Small Council meetings .

Roose,He then shares the story of Ramsay 's birth ; Roose raped a miller 's wife , who had married without his consent , after hanging her husband .
Roose,However , Tywin says that Roose can keep it , because the title alone is enough to give Littlefinger the social standing to be a suitor to Lady Lysa Arryn .

Roose,If he succeeds , Roose will give consideration to legitimizing Ramsay as a member of House Bolton .
Roose,In recognition , Roose presents Ramsay with a decree of legitimization , making him officially a member of House Bolton .
Roose,It was in fact Ramsay Snow and his soldiers from House Bolton who burned Winterfell to the ground : he simply sent false reports for his father Roose to deliver to Robb Stark which claimed that the ironborn were responsible , as the Boltons were preparing to betray the Starks months before the Red Wedding .

Roose Bolton,Ramsay tells her that he is Roose Bolton 's eldest son , legitimized by the king , who Sansa reminds him is another bastard .

Ros,Baelish tells Varys that he is aware of Varys ' arrangement with Ros , and that he has given her to `` a friend '' who is eager for a new experience .

Ros,Varys is surprised that Ros is literate and asks what obvious point it is that he does n't see .

Sandor,Arya notices that they are loading Sandor `` The Hound '' Clegane into a prisoner cart , so she walks over and angrily asks him if he remembers the last time he was here , but he simply says all poor inns look the same .
Sandor,Arya offers to clean and stitch him up , and Sandor allows her to .
Sandor,Arya suggests burning to cauterize the wound , but is rebuffed by Sandor 's fear of fire .

Sandor,Beric even manages to set Sandor 's wooden shield on fire , which is strapped so tightly to Sandor 's arm that he can not remove it and is nearly burned himself .
Sandor,Beric says he knows she must be angry with him , but releasing Sandor was the right thing to do , as they 'd promised to let him go free if he won the trial by combat .
Sandor,Due to the Sandor 's fear of fire , Beric initially has an advantage against the Hound .
Sandor,Eventually , however , Sandor 's raw physical strength and anger ( born of terror ) overpowers Beric , and with a single downward swipe , cuts right through his flaming sword , his armor , and deep into his shoulder , killing him .

Sandor,Ser Loras declares Sandor the victor of the match to the Hound 's discomfort .
Sandor,Shae tries to help Sansa hide the sheets but Sandor finds them .
Sandor,She wonders why Beric would want to let Sandor go when he nearly killed him , but Beric insists that he did actually kill him .
Sandor,The Brotherhood , closing in on something Sandor actually did , charge him with the crime of following orders to kill Mycah , but that they will give him a fair trial : Dondarrion himself will face Sandor in a trial by combat .
Sandor,The Brotherhood had taken all of the gold Sandor had on him ( to fund their cause ) , and in lieu of returning it , Beric gives him a promissory note which will grant payment at the end of the war .
Sandor,Tyrion thanks him for saving Sansa 's life , but Sandor bluntly responds that he did n't do it for him .

Sansa,For the sake of Sansa 's life , Varys urges Eddard to confess to treason .

Sansa,Grand Maester Pycelle extols the virtues of mercy and Joffrey agrees that he could be merciful and send Eddard to the Night 's Watch as his mother has suggested and as Sansa has begged .
Sansa,Guiding a frightened Sansa , they make it across and hide by a fallen tree with Theon hugging Sansa to try to keep her warm .

Sansa,He says he 'll do whatever she asks and Sansa tells him to leave and never come back for her .
Sansa,He says that he is extremely worried that Littlefinger is going to try to take control of Sansa Stark : with Robb Stark 's younger brothers presumed dead at Winterfell , and Arya Stark missing and presumed dead for over a year , Sansa is Robb 's only heir .
Sansa,He tells Sansa that Brienne and Pod will do a better job of looking after her , though he tearfully states that he would have gone with her all the way to Castle Black if necessary .
Sansa,He tells her about Sansa and how he rescued her from a group of would-be rapists .

Sansa,He weighs his choices as he sees both Arya and Sansa present , and chooses to save them by making a false confession .
Sansa,Hearing the dogs still after them , Theon tries to lead them away , telling Sansa to keep heading north for Jon and Castle Black .
Sansa,Horrified , Sansa weeps and insists that she is still a virgin and that Petyr thinks she 's just a stupid girl who does n't know anything , and who can not lie at all so always tells the truth .
Sansa,However , Sandor later finds and takes Sansa into custody .
Sansa,However , he can not lose , for the sake of Ned , Sansa , and Arya , as if he is defeated , Tywin Lannister will show their family no mercy .
Sansa,Immediately after leaving , Tyrion returns to his chambers and calls for Sansa , who simply regards him with a forlorn , tear-streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family 's death .
Sansa,Impressed with her instincts , Baelish admits that Tyrion is in fact innocent , and reveals Sansa 's own part in Joffrey 's death - Ser Dontos ' necklace was in fact the murder weapon , and someone slipped a stone ( which was poisonous ) into Joffrey 's wine .

Sansa,Joffrey then takes Sansa up to the walls to see her father 's head and makes her look at it .

Sansa,Loras is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her , but brightens when discussing the lavish wedding he 's had planned - although Sansa , for once , becomes suspicious when she realizes that Loras seems more excited by the food and the wedding joust than by her .
Sansa,Loras leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover Renly ( riding a mount resembling Loras ) , and Sansa looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother Robb is killed after having his wolf 's head knocked off .
Sansa,Lord Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark arrive safely at the Bloody Gate , though Petyr has Sansa cover her hair , as auburn is widely known as a Tully trait , and introduces her as his niece , Alayne .
Sansa,Lysa , apparently having finally given Robin some independence , reminds him never to reveal Sansa 's identity and tells him to show her to her chambers .
Sansa,Lysa encourages Sansa to keep eating , as she was only telling a story , and anyway , Petyr had three crates of lemons brought from the Crownlands just for Sansa 's cakes .
Sansa,Lysa immediately calms down and comforts Sansa , assuring her that she believes her , and that since neither Tyrion nor Petyr had slept with her , Sansa can proceed to marry Robin .
Sansa,Lysa laments Sansa 's treatment in King 's Landing , ignoring her attempts to defend Tyrion 's character .
Sansa,Lysa releases Sansa and embraces Petyr , who assures Lysa that he only ever loved one woman - her sister .
Sansa,Lysa suddenly degenerates from a kindly aunt into a psychotic newlywed half-mad with jealousy and demands to know why Petyr cares so much about Sansa , and if he has slept with her as he has his whores .
Sansa,Lysa then grabs Sansa and threatens to throw her out for kissing Petyr .
Sansa,Margaery Tyrell consoles Sansa , reminding her that Tyrion is far from the worst Lannister and that Tyrion might be able to make her happy , given his skill as a lover .
Sansa,Margaery plays a small joke on Sansa by saying that her cousin died of a pox which made her face melt off , but is just trying to brighten her spirits ( though in the process is reminded that Sansa is still somewhat naïve ) .
Sansa,Margaery points out that if Sansa were to marry Loras , then she would belong in Highgarden anyway .
Sansa,Margaery then invites Sansa to visit Highgarden in the Reach someday .
Sansa,Meanwhile , Brienne stares intently at Winterfell castle from her room in the inn , waiting for the sign to rescue Sansa .
Sansa,Meanwhile , Ros , who seems to be acting as Littlefinger 's aide , reminisces about the day Sansa was born , when all the bells in Winterfell were rung in celebration .
Sansa,Meanwhile , Sansa 's maid carries a message to her .
Sansa,Myranda admits her jealousy of Sansa , especially since he had promised to marry Myranda back when he was a bastard .
Sansa,Myranda tells Sansa that Ramsay needs her to have an heir and nothing more afterwards , but he does not need all of her in one piece to accomplish that .
Sansa,Myranda threatens Sansa with a bow , however Sansa , weary and realizing she ca n't escape a shot from a bow , tells her to kill her while there is still a part of the real her left .
Sansa,Olenna continues to prod Sansa as she fidgets around , and it becomes obvious that she is visibly afraid about being overheard .
Sansa,Once they are alone in their quarters , a tense moment passes as Sansa nervously and slowly undresses .
Sansa,Outside , Sansa is dragged away by a mob of angry men and is about to be raped , when Sandor `` The Hound '' Clegane arrives and slays her assailants .
Sansa,Over the next few weeks the Stark children grow used to their rapidly-growing direwolves : Robb names his Grey Wind , Sansa calls hers Lady , and Arya names hers Nymeria after a great warrior-queen .
Sansa,Petyr Baelish arrives to speak with Sansa .
Sansa,Petyr Baelish witnesses the action and assures Sansa that he will deal with Lysa , whom he says should discipline her child more often , anyway .
Sansa,Petyr and Robin decide they have to muster the Vale knights to march North and aid Sansa .
Sansa,Petyr muses on how he should have been Sansa 's father , but then tells Sansa that she is more beautiful than her mother Catelyn and kisses Sansa ; who is so shocked that she does n't resist .
Sansa,Podrick thinks that Sansa may be better off at Winterfell now that she is far away from the Lannisters , but Brienne believes that Sansa will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother - the Boltons .
Sansa,Prince Joffrey 's bodyguard , Sandor Clegane , known as `` the Hound , '' a man with half his face burned in a mysterious accident , introduces Sansa to Ser Ilyn Payne , the king 's headsman , a frightening-looking man who had his tongue torn out on the orders of the Mad King many years ago .
Sansa,Prince Joffrey comes to apologize to Sansa for the incident on the Kingsroad .
Sansa,Ramsay assures his father they will recapture Sansa as he 's sent his best men to find her .
Sansa,Ramsay is clearly distressed by the news , which in turn delights Sansa .
Sansa,Ramsay is obviously angered by Sansa 's remarks , but does n't act on it , simply stating that bastards can rise in the world too , informing her of Jon 's appointment as Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch .
Sansa,Ramsay tells her that he is Roose Bolton 's eldest son , legitimized by the king , who Sansa reminds him is another bastard .
Sansa,Ramsay then reveals to Sansa that Reek , who seems miserable to have squashed Sansa 's only hope of an escape , came to him and told him everything .
Sansa,Ramsay then suggests that Reek be the one to give Sansa away at the wedding , since he is the closest thing Sansa has to kin and Roose Bolton accepts the suggestion .
Sansa,Realizing what she has just been saying , Sansa nervously attempts to backtrack .
Sansa,Recalling their earlier discussion of a marriage proposal , Sansa realizes that the proposal is not for him , but for her , and furiously declares that she would rather die than marry Roose Bolton .
Sansa,Reuniting , Podrick mentions how both Stark girls denied her request for protection , but Brienne retorts by doubting Sansa is safe with Littlefinger .
Sansa,Robb receives a letter from Sansa in King 's Landing , asking him to pledge fealty to King Joffrey .
Sansa,Robert agrees , but offers a sweetener : the hand of his son , Joffrey , in marriage to Eddard 's daughter , Sansa .
Sansa,Roose Bolton meets with Ramsay afterwards and asks if preemptively assaulting the struggling army of Stannis Baratheon makes him feel like a winner now that they 've lost Sansa .
Sansa,Royce reminds Baelish that he told him that he was taking Sansa with him to The Fingers , but he received word that she had been married to Ramsay Bolton .
Sansa,Sansa asks if they have anything to fear from Lord Yohn ; Littlefinger explains that he does n't trust the retainers and soldiers who saw them , and is taking Sansa somewhere the Lannisters will never find her .
Sansa,Sansa asks what will happen on the off chance that Stannis gets killed , and Littlefinger explains that marrying Ramsay Bolton now will at least leave Sansa in a position to insinuate herself among the Boltons and help destroy them from within in future plans .
Sansa,Sansa is initially reluctant , but when Olenna mentions her father , Sansa breaks down and , her eyes blazing , angrily recounts how Joffrey had said he would show her father mercy , only to behead him in front of her , and how he then took her up to the wall and forced her to look at her father 's head on a spike and claim him providing her father with a swift death was `` mercy '' .
Sansa,Sansa is worried that this means the Tyrells will cancel their proposed marriage alliance ( meaning Sansa will be stuck with Joffrey again ) , but Olenna assures her that her son Mace is too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything .
Sansa,Seeing Reek in such a pitiful condition , Sansa angrily storms away .
Sansa,Ser Loras Tyrell arrives at the door and escorts Sansa to the gardens to meet with Margaery and their grandmother , Lady Olenna Tyrell .
Sansa,Ser Meryn punches Sansa violently in the stomach and strikes her in the back of the legs with the flat of his sword , causing her to fall down .
Sansa,Shae asks Tyrion Lannister for help protecting Sansa .
Sansa,Shae confirms that she is in love with Tyrion and that she cares deeply for Sansa as well , but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses , Shae will not leave until or unless Tyrion asks her to .
Sansa,Shae continues to warn Sansa that Baelish is manipulative and men usually only want `` one thing '' from pretty young ladies , and `` love '' often is n't what they 're after .
Sansa,Shae dresses Sansa Stark in her chambers , and warns Sansa about Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish .
Sansa,Shae reports as Sansa 's new handmaiden , allowing Sansa to vent some frustration about her inexperience .
Sansa,Shae suggests that Baelish is actually sexually attracted to Sansa .
Sansa,Shae tells Sansa to go to her chambers , lock herself in , and await Stannis , as he would not harm her , but Ser Ilyn might .
Sansa,Shae tries to help Sansa hide the sheets but Sandor finds them .
Sansa,She also rants about Catelyn 's love for Sansa 's uncle Brandon and how he nearly killed Petyr .
Sansa,She and Septa Mordane discuss the expectation that Sansa will have to provide Joffrey with an heir .
Sansa,She asks Shae to look out for Sansa , particularly in regards to Littlefinger .
Sansa,She asks Tyrion which one of them should be the one to break the news to Sansa .
Sansa,She is stopped when Petyr arrives and swears by everything he can think of that he will send Sansa away .
Sansa,She offers to help Sansa take a bath , so she is presentable to Ramsay during the wedding .
Sansa,She points out that Baelish has offered to help Sansa for nothing in return , which probably means that he 's after something .
Sansa,She points out that there will be two feather beds , and Varys realizes Littlefinger would only pay the extra money for someone other than Littlefinger if it was Sansa .
Sansa,She testifies that Tyrion and Sansa planned Joffrey 's murder together , claiming that Sansa wanted vengeance for the murder of her father , mother , and brother .
Sansa,Some time later , Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton stating that he has Rickon Stark at Winterfell and if Sansa is not returned , he will slaughter every Wildling at Castle Black , let his men rape Sansa , and feed Jon and Rickon to his dogs .
Sansa,Stannis will then make Sansa the new ruler of the North , as the last ( known ) surviving Stark heir and in memory of her father Eddard 's support for Stannis .
Sansa,Stunned by this admission , Sansa 's anger towards Reek cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone , calling him Theon again , he breaks down and runs out the room , crying , `` Not Theon !
Sansa,Terrified of being brought to Joffrey , Sansa is instead brought before Queen Regent Cersei Lannister , who awkwardly tries to comfort her .
Sansa,The Boltons greet Sansa and Baelish At Winterfell itself , the Boltons and their households greet Sansa and Littlefinger .
Sansa,The Hound scares Sansa , but tells her to look at him , saying that since the world is made up of killers like Stannis , her father , her brother Robb , and he himself , she better get used to looking at them .
Sansa,The War of the Five Kings is not going well for the Starks now , and if Robb were to be defeated and die , the man who controls Sansa controls the North .
Sansa,The ceremony is a grim affair ; Joffrey smugly escorts Sansa to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which Tyrion was to stand on to cloak Sansa in Lannister colors as part of the ceremony , eliciting snickers from the congregation ( though the scowl of Lord Tywin quickly silences them ) .
Sansa,The following morning , Shae notices with a hint of a smile that Sansa 's bed sheets are not stained with blood and Tyrion 's virgin bride is still a virgin .
Sansa,The parties depart Winterfell : Jon , Tyrion and Benjen Stark to the Wall ; and Eddard , Arya , Sansa and the royal party south to King 's Landing .
Sansa,The thought of finally escaping Joffrey , being wed to her idol and becoming a Tyrell makes Sansa choke out tears of joy .
Sansa,The tournament begins and Sansa watches from the stands .
Sansa,Then , in front of the Godswood , Reek gives Sansa away to Ramsay ( who actually allows Reek to call himself Theon Greyjoy ) during the wedding ceremony , which is officiated by Roose Bolton and attended by many Northern Lords .
Sansa,Theon and Sansa , having survived the fall from Winterfell 's wall , run through the Wolfswood realizing there are already men with hounds chasing them .
Sansa,Theon and Sansa prepare to jump .
Sansa,Theon claims Sansa was hurt when they jumped and he left her to die , but the dogs find her .
Sansa,They are bound for Castle Black , where Brienne believes Sansa may have taken refuge with her half-brother , Jon Snow .
Sansa,They manipulate Sansa into writing a letter to her brother Robb , asking him to bend the knee peacefully to Joffrey .
Sansa,This disturbs Sansa , but she thinks it is simply impossible , as Baelish is so much older than her .
Sansa,This irritates Sansa and Robin throws a tantrum in response .
Sansa,Though Littlefinger told Lord Royce that he and Sansa would be traveling to the Fingers , they instead head west .
Sansa,To help Sansa `` remember '' how things used to be , Myranda leads Sansa down to the kennels , where she finds Reek , formerly Theon Greyjoy , asleep in one of the cages .
Sansa,Tyrion 's fears prove accurate as Shae bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds Sansa .
Sansa,Tyrion , Sansa , Shae , and another handmaiden are sitting in a garden .
Sansa,Tyrion agrees that maybe this would give Joffrey a chance to release his frustrations away from Sansa .
Sansa,Tyrion attempts to console his wife but fails ; Sansa has heard the gruesome details of the Red Wedding , how the corpses of her mother and brother were desecrated .
Sansa,Tyrion comforts the shaken Sansa and personally escorts her out of the hall .
Sansa,Tyrion decides he might as well dash Sansa 's hopes sooner rather than later .
Sansa,Tyrion flatly forbids it and tells Joffrey that Sansa is n't his to torment anymore .
Sansa,Tyrion flatly refuses , but Tywin points out that recently he was complaining that he was n't rewarded for his actions in the Battle of the Blackwater , and as heiress to the North , Sansa is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is long past time Tyrion was we
Sansa,Tyrion gives Shae a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to Sansa .
Sansa,Tyrion in the face of humiliation asks Sansa to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders .
Sansa,Tyrion insists that Sansa had nothing to do with the murder , despite having the best motive .
Sansa,Tyrion is amused but is confused by the term , though he realizes belatedly that Sansa has misheard the word `` shit '' .
Sansa,Tyrion is visibly startled by the news , already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause , but Joffrey brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve Robb 's severed head to Sansa at his wedding feast .
Sansa,Tyrion promises Sansa that he will not mistreat her , and Sansa agrees there are worse Lannisters she could be wed to .
Sansa,Tyrion protests that Sansa is a child , but Cersei counters she has flowered and is a woman now who can bear children .
Sansa,Tyrion questions how Sansa is the key to the North , given that her older brother is still alive .
Sansa,Tyrion refuses to force himself on Sansa to do his duty , and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the Lannisters have murdered her mother and brother .
Sansa,Tyrion reminds Sansa that he 's used to it , as he 's always been a dwarf .
Sansa,Tyrion says that he no longer has enough power or influence to attempt to do that , though Shae accuses him of being attracted to Sansa , which he cheerfully denies .
Sansa,Tyrion thanks him for saving Sansa 's life , but Sandor bluntly responds that he did n't do it for him .
Sansa,Tyrion tries to protest , pointing out that Joffrey has made Sansa 's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force Tyrion on her after she has finally escaped Joffrey is cruel , even by Tywin 's standards .
Sansa,Tyrion turns his wrath upon Joffrey , berating his actions as Sansa is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming ( and the fact that Joffrey does n't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp ) .
Sansa,Tywin again waxes poetic about family , noting Tyrion 's failure to consummate his marriage to Sansa .
Sansa,Tywin explains that the Tyrells are plotting to wed Sansa to Ser Loras and states that he will not allow them to steal `` the key to the north '' out from under him .
Sansa,Tywin questions if Tyrion plans to mistreat Sansa and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl 's happiness and neither should his son .
Sansa,Unable to control her anger , Sansa slaps Robin .
Sansa,Undeterred , Shae starts undressing Tyrion , and asks him for a favor ; to protect Sansa from Baelish .
Sansa,Upon arriving at the Eyrie itself , Sansa tries to slip into her alias , but Lysa Arryn tells her not to bother around her own flesh and blood .
Sansa,Varys points out that Sansa is Joffrey 's aunt by marriage now ( and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords ) .
Sansa,Varys tells Eddard that Sansa begged for his life before the whole court and that Robb is leading an army from the North .
Sansa,When Nymeria can not be found , Cersei spitefully requests that Sansa 's direwolf Lady be killed instead , and Robert acquiesces , upsetting Sansa and angering Arya .
Sansa,When Reek refuses to do it , Sansa reminds him of his true name , Theon Greyjoy , and makes him promise that he 'll help her .
Sansa,When Sansa questions what he will do if she never does , Tyrion sarcastically jokes `` And so my watch begins '' - implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the Night 's Watch - and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch .
Sansa,When they are confronted by Lannister guardsmen led by Sandor Clegane , Septa Mordane tells Sansa to run and lock herself in her room while she stays to confront them .

Sansa Stark,He has Sansa Stark brought before the assembled court in the recently redecorated throne room , which now boasts iron spikes on many surfaces and roaring fires surrounding the pillars .
Sansa Stark,He says that he is extremely worried that Littlefinger is going to try to take control of Sansa Stark : with Robb Stark 's younger brothers presumed dead at Winterfell , and Arya Stark missing and presumed dead for over a year , Sansa is Robb 's only heir .
Sansa Stark,He then asks of Brienne 's business , to which she replies that she is in Lady Stark 's service to find and protect Sansa Stark .

Sansa Stark,Lord Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark arrive safely at the Bloody Gate , though Petyr has Sansa cover her hair , as auburn is widely known as a Tully trait , and introduces her as his niece , Alayne .
Sansa Stark,Margaery is not a naive ingenue like Sansa Stark but versed in court strategies : she honestly believes that Renly is the best candidate for king , and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between Renly and House Tyrell .
Sansa Stark,Meanwhile , in King 's Landing , Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark walk through the gardens .
Sansa Stark,Podrick spots Sansa Stark with Petyr Baelish , and Brienne tells him to ready the horses and she confronts them .

Sansa Stark,She also advises him to be kind to his betrothed Sansa Stark to avoid stirring up trouble for later , and concludes that `` Anyone who is n't us is an enemy . ''
Sansa Stark,She drinks wine heavily during the assault and seems , to simultaneously torment and mother her captive , Sansa Stark , with a sort of cynical feminism involving dire descriptions of the rapes that will occur if the city falls .
Sansa Stark,She then reports on how frequently Littlefinger has visited Sansa Stark , and says she thinks he is obsessed with her , and wants to smuggle her out of the city .

Sapphire Isle,Jaime is disgusted by this pointless brutality , so he points out to Locke that Brienne is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of Lord Selwyn of Tarth , the `` Sapphire Isle , '' and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires - provided that she is unharmed .
Sapphire Isle,The captain corrects him , stating that they are sailing through the Sapphire Isle , which reminds him of Brienne .
Sapphire Isle,While Brienne is a noblewoman and worth a ransom , Tarth is called `` the Sapphire Isle '' due to the color of the seas around it , not because there are any actual sapphires , and House Tarth is not particularly rich .
Savior of the City,Lord Tywin Lannister is officially named Hand of the King and Savior of the City .

Second Sons,A Meereenese prostitute helps them distract and kill some of the Second Sons , and when a patrol of Unsullied arrives , she feigns fear and directs them into a trap by pointing that the Sons of the Harpy ran into a narrow alleyway .
Second Sons,Daario Naharis , commander of the Second Sons , then volunteers to be Dany 's champion , and she accepts .
Second Sons,Daario explains that he has been using the Second Sons as spies throughout Meereen , since they are far less conspicuous than Unsullied and can indulge in the same vices as their informants ; Daario indicates his men 's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall , seriously injuring the man hiding behind it .
Second Sons,Daenerys , Jorah and Barristan hide behind a ruined building to spy on the encampment of the Second Sons , a professional mercenary company , the `` powerful friends '' the Yunkish have employed .
Second Sons,Daenerys tells Barristan to organize a meeting with the Second Sons ' captains , saying that men who fight for gold `` ca n't afford to lose to a girl . ''
Second Sons,Daenerys tells Jorah that she sent Daario to take the Second Sons to Yunkai to regain control over the city and kill the masters that have resurfaced .
Second Sons,Dany counters that the Second Sons are currently acting as Meereen 's police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him ; Daario dismisses the Second Sons ' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants is n't interested .
Second Sons,He begs Daenerys to send him and the Second Sons to make real war .
Second Sons,Later , Daario convinces her to reconsider , as his youth fighting in the pits gave him the fighting skills necessary for him to join the Second Sons , where he met Daenerys .
Second Sons,Once the sellswords are gone , Daenerys drops her pretence of cordiality and while glowering at Mero 's back , instructs Barristan that if they must fight the Second Sons , he is to kill Mero first .
Second Sons,She had seduced and murdered several members of the Second Sons and Unsullied .
Second Sons,She is irritated to learn that Daario Naharis has captured Meereen 's navy without her explicit orders to do so , but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for Westeros and taking King 's Landing with her 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons .
Second Sons,The Second Sons will be stationed in Yunkai to enforce whichever choice the masters make .
Second Sons,Vala is defiant and states that she opposes the new regime imposed by the Unsullied and Second Sons as illegitimate .
Selmy,Barristan Selmy is optimistic about their chances , believing that old Westerosi families will flock to their cause once Daenerys crosses the Narrow Sea , swelling their numbers .
Selmy,Barristan Selmy tells Daenarys the truth about her father , the Mad King .
Selmy,Both Jorah and Selmy strongly object , and plead to Daenerys that while soldiers are valuable , it is dragons that will ultimately win her the Iron Throne .
Selmy,Selmy is confused , pointing out that Kingsguard serve for life , but Joffrey angrily says that Selmy is too old , and could n't protect his father .
Selmy,Upon leaving the room , she scolds Jorah and Selmy , telling them that while she values their advice , they should never again question her in public .
Selmy,Varys announces that Selmy is to be given a castle and land in recognition of his years of service , but the old knight , insulted by what he sees as being offered `` a hall to die in and men to bury me , '' takes off his armor , throws his sword at Joffrey 's feet and storms out , stating that he could still kill all five of the other Kingsguard present with ease .
Selyse,- eventually even Selyse , who only had a cold and non-existent relationship with her daughter , suddenly breaks and rushes forward , begging that they ca n't go through with it .
Selyse,Afterwards , Stannis and Selyse eat dinner , with Melisandre as a guest at their table .
Selyse,Another soldier comes with more bad news : Selyse has hanged herself out of grief for her daughter .
Selyse,Due to his extreme belief in duty , ( unlike his hedonistic brother Robert ) Stannis is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to Selyse , when he had sex with Melisandre to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly .
Selyse,He also wants to take Selyse and Shireen with them , as he does not think they will be safe at the Wall , surrounded by criminals .
Selyse,He finds her in her chamber , praying over a fire to the Lord of Light : Selyse is a fanatical believer in the Lord of Light religion , far more so than Stannis , and it was indeed Selyse who first invited Melisandre to Dragonstone .
Selyse,Jon Snow trains recruits in the practice yard of Castle Black , as Stannis Baratheon and his wife Selyse watch , along with their daughter Shireen .
Selyse,Melisandre is surprisingly silent throughout the proceedings ; it is Selyse who takes the greatest pleasure in the ritual .
Selyse,Queen Selyse interrupts the proceedings and dismisses Sam and Gilly .
Selyse,Queen Selyse speaks to Melisandre , who is enjoying a bath .
Selyse,Selyse then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the North but Melisandre is as dismissive about Shireen's '' heresy '' as she always is , and assures Selyse that Shireen will be needed where they are going .
Selyse,She quips that the Lord of Light told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath , but the joke goes over Selyse 's head .
Selyse,Shireen 's cries become even more frightened , but Stannis continues to watch even as Selyse sobs on the ground .
Selyse,Stannis and Selyse do not have a loving relationship , but she reveres and is in awe of him as her king and the Lord 's Chosen .

Seven Kingdoms,Roose dispatches Locke with orders to find and kill Bran and Rickon ; Reek suggests that Jon Snow might either be sheltering the boys at Castle Black or at least may know where they have gone , while Ramsay advocates killing Jon as well , given that the fact he has Stark blood could lead to him becoming a threat , since the Northeners will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge ( although harming Jon would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the Night 's Watch and thus legally untouchable by the Seven Kingdoms ) .
Seven Kingdoms,She asks Jorah to help convince her husband since the Seven Kingdoms are hers by birthright but he reminds her that her ancestor Aegon the Conqueror took six of the Seven Kingdoms , because he was capable of doing so ( due to his dragons ) , nothing more .

Shae,She also begins to question Shae , who seems to her perhaps an unlikely handmaiden .
Shae,She asks Shae to look out for Sansa , particularly in regards to Littlefinger .
Shae,The following morning , Shae notices with a hint of a smile that Sansa 's bed sheets are not stained with blood and Tyrion 's virgin bride is still a virgin .

Shae,Tyrion can not read Shae 's personality , but this only makes her more intriguing to him .
Shae,Tyrion gives Shae a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to Sansa .
Shae,Tyrion guesses that Shae 's mother was a whore , her father deserted them , and she is low born - however he is wrong on each guess .
Shae,Tyrion hides his lover Shae in his chambers in the Tower of the Hand because he was forbidden by his father to bring her with him .
Shae,Tyrion is relieved that Shae is safe but vows revenge against his sister .
Shae,Tyrion returns and finds Shae in his bed .
Shae,Tyrion says he can not go back to Tywin 's chambers because Shae 's body is still there .

Shae,Undeterred , Shae starts undressing Tyrion , and asks him for a favor ; to protect Sansa from Baelish .
Shae,Varys divulges that Shae has been spotted and that his sister , Cersei , has been notified .
Shae,Varys is convinced that Tyrion is the last hope for the Seven Kingdoms ' current regime , therefore Shae is a weakness that Tyrion , and thus the realm , can not afford .

Shireen,As she explained to Stannis before , she believes that sacrificing Shireen 's life - which contains the power of a king 's blood - will gain the Lord of Light 's favor , who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard .
Shireen,As the flames begin to consume Shireen she wordlessly screams in pain and fear , and eventually even Stannis can not bear to look anymore as she burns to death .
Shireen,Everyone claimed Shireen would die of it sooner or later , and urged Stannis to send her to the ruins of Valyria to live out her days with the `` Stone Men '' before the disease infected the rest of the castle ; Stannis says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer , apothecary and Maester he could to save Shireen .
Shireen,He also wants to take Selyse and Shireen with them , as he does not think they will be safe at the Wall , surrounded by criminals .

Shireen,Nonetheless , Melisandre does speak with Shireen , who heard the death of her uncle from her bedroom window , explaining in gentle yet matter-of-fact terms that the Faith of the Seven and its holy books are lies : Melisandre insists there are only two gods , the Lord of Light and the Great Other , constantly at war .
Shireen,Others turn away from the scene as well , including Gilly and Shireen .
Shireen,Selyse switches tactics and suggests that Melisandre speak to Shireen .
Shireen,Selyse then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter Shireen behind when they go to the North but Melisandre is as dismissive about Shireen's '' heresy '' as she always is , and assures Selyse that Shireen will be needed where they are going .
Shireen,Ser Davos pressures Melisandre for news , specifically asking after Shireen , but Melisandre remains silent .
Shireen,She lectures Shireen on the dangers of spending time with any wildlings , since they could conceivably use Gilly to harm Stannis through Shireen .
Shireen,Shireen asks her father if he is ashamed of her because of her deformity ; Stannis gets up from his table and explains that not long after Shireen was born , a Dornish trader arrived on Dragonstone and , having heard of Shireen 's birth , gave a wooden doll as a gift for the newborn girl .
Shireen,Some time after Davos leaves , Stannis himself visits Shireen , visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly .
Shireen,Stannis and Shireen 's mother Selyse then appear in the crowd .
Shireen,Stannis begins to apologise for dragging her along on campaign with him , as Castle Black is hardly a place for a child , but Shireen cuts him off ; she is happy to have come , having expected to be left at Dragonstone , as Selyse had made it clear she wanted .
Shireen,Stannis insists that Shireen is his daughter and he would not send her away because she belonged with her family .
Shireen,Stannis watches as Shireen is sacrificed .
Shireen,They have a quiet laugh , and Shireen starts to read to Davos An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros .
Shireen,Undaunted , Shireen offers to teach him how to read , by coming down to his cell and reading to him when Bert is on duty .
Shireen,Unfortunately , the doll was contaminated with greyscale , and by the time that was discovered , Shireen had already contracted the disease .
Shireen,When Shireen asks if there is any truth to the Faith 's belief in seven heavens and seven hells , Melisandre replies `` There is only one hell ... the one we live in now '' .
Shireen,When he asks about Shireen , Melisandre is reluctant to speak .
Shireen 's Greyscale,Gilly asks about Shireen 's Greyscale scars , revealing that the wildlings do n't really have a word for it and that two of her sisters contracted and were driven mad by the disease , before Craster put them out of their misery .
Shireen 's Greyscale,Melisandre joins them and appears to quite firmly take Stannis 's side , declaring that the Lord of Light does n't care about Shireen 's Greyscale disfigurement , and this does n't change the fact that she has her father 's blood .

Stannis,A furious Stannis sentences Davos to death but the Onion Knight produces a letter from the Night 's Watch .
Stannis,After extracting a promise from Davos that he wo n't act against Melisandre again , Stannis has him released .
Stannis,After the battle she waits and finds a wounded Stannis .
Stannis,After the candle is lit , she sees the Boltons clash with Stannis 's army and sees this as a time to slip out of Winterfell .
Stannis,After the defeated remnant of Stannis ' forces returned to the island , Melisandre ordered any who spoke out against her to be burned alive as offerings to the Lord of Light .
Stannis,Afterwards , Stannis and Selyse eat dinner , with Melisandre as a guest at their table .
Stannis,As part of the magical ritual that follows , Stannis throws the leeches into the flames at Melisandre 's direction , and recites the names of three people he wants dead as they burn : `` The usurper Robb Stark , the usurper Balon Greyjoy , the usurper Joffrey Baratheon . ''
Stannis,As she explained to Stannis before , she believes that sacrificing Shireen 's life - which contains the power of a king 's blood - will gain the Lord of Light 's favor , who in return will aid them in their time of need by lifting the blizzard .
Stannis,As the flames begin to consume Shireen she wordlessly screams in pain and fear , and eventually even Stannis can not bear to look anymore as she burns to death .
Stannis,At first , Stannis hesitates claiming he has a wife but Melisandre still manages to successfully seduce Stannis .
Stannis,At first Tycho Nestoris , a representative from the bank , rejects their request , but Davos entreats him and points out that funding Stannis is the best way they could possibly get the gold they loaned to Tywin Lannister back .
Stannis,At the mention of his son Davos draws a knife on her in a fit of anger , but he is restrained by the guards , and Stannis orders him put in the dungeon .
Stannis,Baelish counsels patience and suggests letting the Boltons and Stannis fight each other , and when the victor is still recovering from the battle , step in and defeat him .
Stannis,Because he will not fight for Stannis , his punishment is death by being burned alive .
Stannis,Before they leave the wildling camp , Jon also urges Stannis to burn the dead before nightfall .
Stannis,Bolton toys with Jaime but remains completely calm , never even grinning , before finally revealing that his sister Cersei is alive and well , and his father 's forces successfully repulsed Stannis 's assault .
Stannis,Both Stannis and Renly have claimed the Iron Throne , meaning the Lannisters are now faced with fighting a two-front war against the Starks to the north and the Baratheons to the south .
Stannis,Catelyn attempts to broker a peace between Stannis and Renly .
Stannis,Catelyn reminds Stannis that their common enemy is the Lannisters , but he will not hear it , again asserting his right to the Iron Throne .
Stannis,Davos , having returned to Castle Black at Stannis ' orders , urges Jon to convince the Wildlings for aid .
Stannis,Davos Seaworth meets with Stannis and informs him that forty horses died the previous night and more will die come sunset .
Stannis,Davos asks what happened to Stannis and she replies he was defeated in battle .
Stannis,Davos insists that it is Stannis ' duty to assist the black brothers , and that he will need Davos 's assistance to rally troops and mercenaries .
Stannis,Davos introduces Stannis as the true king of the Seven Kingdoms , but Mance wryly points out that they are not currently in the Seven Kingdoms .
Stannis,Davos is confused given that even if Jon did decide to resupply them the provisions probably would n't reach them in time , and wonders why Stannis would send him instead of just a messenger .
Stannis,Davos openly calls Melisandre his enemy , condemns her for conducting human sacrifices , and says she is leading Stannis astray .
Stannis,Davos speculates that the real reason Stannis came is because deep down , a part of him knows what he 's about to do is wrong and he knew Davos would tell him the truth he needs to hear , regardless of how it would be taken .
Stannis,Davos suggests waiting until Jon returns with the wildlings , but Stannis decides against it , as any delay improves the Boltons ' chances .
Stannis,Davos thinks that they should go back to Castle Black and wait out the weather since they do not have enough food , but Stannis stubbornly tells him that they will not retreat to Castle Black because he will not risk being known as `` the King who Ran '' .
Stannis,Davos visits the tent of Stannis 's daughter Shireen Baratheon to say goodbye .
Stannis,Dismissive of the threat posed by Stannis following the Battle of the Blackwater , Joffrey leafs through the Book of Brothers , which details the history of the Kingsguard and those who served in it .
Stannis,Due to his extreme belief in duty , ( unlike his hedonistic brother Robert ) Stannis is badly shaken by the fact that he broke his marriage vows to Selyse , when he had sex with Melisandre to create the Shadow-assassin creature that killed Renly .
Stannis,Everyone claimed Shireen would die of it sooner or later , and urged Stannis to send her to the ruins of Valyria to live out her days with the `` Stone Men '' before the disease infected the rest of the castle ; Stannis says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer , apothecary and Maester he could to save Shireen .
Stannis,Forlorn over the death of his son Matthos , Davos feels that Melisandre has led Stannis to disaster , and is horrified to hear from Salladhor that she has begun to conduct human sacrifices .
Stannis,From the battlements , Joffrey berates Tyrion , demanding to know why his ships are not meeting Stannis 's fleet .
Stannis,Growing tense over their falling out , Stannis briefly explains that Ser Davos is a traitor and is rotting in the dungeon .
Stannis,He also assures Jon that Stannis 's leadership advice is offered because the king has taken a liking to him .
Stannis,He angrily roars about how he saved King 's Landing from Stannis Baratheon 's forces and says he should 've allowed Stannis to kill everyone in King 's Landing , much to the horror and disgust of the people in the court .
Stannis,He argues with Stannis again about sacrificing the boy , but Stannis is convinced by Melisandre that using Gendry as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the Iron Throne .
Stannis,He asks how Davos can doubt the power of Melisandre 's God when Stannis has seen visions of `` a great battle in the snow '' and Davos saw the creature she gave birth to .
Stannis,He finds Stannis despondent , sitting in the Chamber of the Painted Table alone with Melisandre .
Stannis,He finds her in her chamber , praying over a fire to the Lord of Light : Selyse is a fanatical believer in the Lord of Light religion , far more so than Stannis , and it was indeed Selyse who first invited Melisandre to Dragonstone .
Stannis,He leads his men through the tunnels beneath the city and is able to defeat Stannis 's troops manning a battering ram at the Mud Gate .
Stannis,He offers to take her north to Winterfell , but she says she will be safe there when Stannis takes the throne .
Stannis,He rejects Davos 's appeal to consider an alliance with his brother Renly Baratheon , while Renly is claiming the throne for himself , despite Renly having widespread support , or even with Robb Stark , since while Robb does not seek the Iron Throne , he desires Northern independence , which Stannis sees as Robb `` stealing the Northern half of his kingdom . ''
Stannis,He then reveals to Ramsay that Stannis has an army at Castle Black .
Stannis,He tries to gain Renly 's trust by implying that if Renly does march on the capital , he will help take down the Lannisters from within ( it is unclear if he is lying , but he is also ready to jump ship if the Lannisters lose , and Stannis is not an option , because Stannis despises Littlefinger ) ; Renly is tempted by the notion , despite his dislike for Littlefinger .
Stannis,He wants Ramsay 's help in defeating Stannis , and Ramsay agrees .
Stannis,His son Matthos Seaworth encourages him to learn to read so that he can study the holy texts of the Lord of Light but Davos is happy to put his faith solely in Stannis .
Stannis,However , House Tyrell of the Reach has retreated its large army back to their capital at Highgarden , and has not joined Stannis .
Stannis,However , Robb does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for : Tywin withdrew his garrison to King 's Landing to counter the attack by Stannis , and did n't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle .
Stannis,In a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him , Stannis offers Renly that if he relinquishes his claim , Stannis will grant him his old seat on the small council , and even name him as his heir ( unless Stannis ever has a son in the future ) .
Stannis,In addition , the Queen is more concerned over the intentions of King Robert 's brother , Stannis , a proven battle commander known to be without mercy .
Stannis,In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to Lord Stannis and instructs a courier to take the message to Dragonstone , Stannis 's island fortress .
Stannis,Indeed , she wept for joy when Melisandre told her of this service she did for the Lord of Light with Stannis , and because the Red Priestess gave him a `` son '' ( of sorts ) which she never could .
Stannis,Instead he sends a single ship filled with Wildfire into the heart of Stannis 's fleet , leaking the volatile substance over the surface of the water .
Stannis,Jaime ( who had previously noted to his father that thousands in King 's Landing alone still want Joffrey dead ) points out that the war is far from won ; Stannis is still alive and will probably raise fresh armies .
Stannis,Jon Snow 's attempts at training Olly are interrupted by Melisandre , who has been sent to fetch Jon for an audience with Stannis .
Stannis,Jon also reiterates the Night 's Watch 's neutrality in the affairs of the Seven Kingdoms and asks Stannis when he plans to leave ; Castle Black 's stores are insufficient to feed the Night 's Watch , Stannis 's army , and the wildling prisoners indefinitely .
Stannis,Jon declines Stannis 's offer and reiterates that his place is with the Night 's Watch .
Stannis,Jon is visibly moved at the prospect of having his lifelong dream finally come true , but he later admits to Sam that he plans to turn Stannis down : he is a man of the Night 's Watch .
Stannis,Jon refuses him , saying that they would n't side with Stannis and this is not their fight .
Stannis,Jon relay 's Stannis ' offer to Mance .
Stannis,Jon says that he knows that Stannis is the true king , as his own father died supporting his claim , revealing himself as the bastard son of Eddard Stark .
Stannis,Jon tells Stannis that , like the Wildlings , the Northerners will only follow one of their own .
Stannis,Later , Stannis is in his chambers at Castle Black working on other letters , and Shireen enters .
Stannis,Later , Stannis tells Ser Davos that they will march toward Winterfell the next morning .
Stannis,Maester Cressen is outraged at the affront to his gods and fearful that Melisandre is leading Stannis into a war that he can not win .
Stannis,Marching across the fields with less than half the men he once had , Stannis has his men start preparing for the siege , but is instead met in combat early by the Bolton army .
Stannis,Meanwhile , Bronn gives a lesson to an unlikely pupil ; Bran 's vision helps map out his journey ; Stannis loses patience with Davos ; and Ramsay takes a perverse delight in his new pet .
Stannis,Meanwhile , Davos Seaworth , still languishing in his cell , is paid a visit by Stannis ; Davos is told of the impending sacrifice of Gendry .
Stannis,Melisandre assures him , reminding him that he also saw the vision of his victory in the flames , but Stannis is not so sure what he saw anymore .
Stannis,Melisandre insists that the Lord of Light only allows her glimpses and that Stannis can not abandon the war because of a single defeat .
Stannis,Melisandre joins them and appears to quite firmly take Stannis 's side , declaring that the Lord of Light does n't care about Shireen 's Greyscale disfigurement , and this does n't change the fact that she has her father 's blood .
Stannis,Melisandre proclaims Stannis a champion of the Lord of Light , as he draws a burning sword from one of the statues .
Stannis,Melisandre says that she can not : creating a shadow-creature drains some of the fire of a man 's life-force , and she fears that creating another would kill Stannis .
Stannis,Melisandre seduces Stannis with the promise of a son .
Stannis,Melisandre stares at the broken wrecks of Stannis 's fleet destroyed by the wildfire , asserting that her presence might have turned the tide of battle .
Stannis,Melisandre tells Stannis he will betray his men , his family and his beliefs but in the end , it will be worth it ; she assures Stannis that he is the Lord 's Chosen and he will be king .
Stannis,Most of Stannis ' army has been destroyed , and the only reason the Lannisters have n't attacked Dragonstone yet is because so much of their fleet was destroyed at Blackwater that they can not yet mount an amphibious assault .
Stannis,On the night of his execution , Mance stands before Stannis , and although he can not bend the knee , he offers him luck in the wars to come .
Stannis,Quickly cutting the wildling forces down , Stannis and Davos ride up to Mance , who throws down his weapons in surrender , officially ending the wildlings ' siege of Castle Black .
Stannis,Ramsay , on the other hand , has a plan to defeat Stannis decisively and asks his father to lend him `` just 20 good men . ''
Stannis,Ramsay speaks of his thoughts on how they will easily defeat Stannis 's army since their soldiers , unlike Stannis 's , are trained to fight in the snow , and how he 'll one day be the Lord of Winterfell and the Warden of the North .
Stannis,Realizing this is true , Stannis makes Jon an enticing offer : if he leaves the Night 's Watch , Stannis will use his authority as king to officially legitimize him as Jon Stark , Lord of Winterfell , so he can rally the North to Stannis 's side and resume the fight against the Boltons , Freys , and Lannisters .
Stannis,Renly , along with his Kingsguard members Brienne and Ser Loras Tyrell , counters that no one wants Stannis to be king .
Stannis,Renly also scoffs at Stannis ' conversion to the religion of the Lord of Light .
Stannis,Renly states that the 100,000 soldiers waving his banners makes him king , and Stannis ' small army is hopelessly outnumbered .
Stannis,Renly suggests that he could make a good king , but Eddard angrily points out that Stannis is Renly 's older brother and the true heir .
Stannis,Renly watches his brother fade into the distance and asks his companions if they can believe that he loved Stannis once .
Stannis,Resignedly , Mance says that the Free Folk do not kneel , knowing that Stannis will kill him if he does not .
Stannis,Roose Bolton maintains that his army must wait inside Winterfell , thus starving out Stannis ' forces , as Winterfell had enough supplies to last 6 months under siege .
Stannis,Sansa asks what will happen on the off chance that Stannis gets killed , and Littlefinger explains that marrying Ramsay Bolton now will at least leave Sansa in a position to insinuate herself among the Boltons and help destroy them from within in future plans .
Stannis,Sansa will be alone with the Boltons but he explains his plan to her : Stannis will have to attack the Boltons soon if he is to beat the winter snows , and he bets that Stannis will probably win , because he is one of the best military commanders in all of Westeros , and the Boltons will be outnumbered by Stannis , as the other northern houses would be quick to betray their liege lord .
Stannis,Seeing no other way to convince Stannis otherwise , Davos leaves .
Stannis,Seizing on whatever hope she still has , however , she says that the Lord of Light brought Jon back for a reason ; that Stannis was not The Prince That Was Promised , but `` someone must be . ''
Stannis,Selyse asks her if she used the potions when she slept with Stannis , to which she replies that she did not .
Stannis,Selyse had three sons with Stannis but they were all stillborn , and she walks over to a corner of her chamber where she keeps their tiny corpses preserved in glass jars .
Stannis,Selyse is worried that Stannis wishes Jon was his son , because she gave him only stillbirths and weakness , but he says that was n't her fault .
Stannis,Shae tells Sansa to go to her chambers , lock herself in , and await Stannis , as he would not harm her , but Ser Ilyn might .
Stannis,She also tells them that she executed Stannis after he admitted using blood magic to assassinate Renly .
Stannis,She angrily denies supporting Stannis , thus confirming that she served Renly .
Stannis,She asks if Stannis intends to leave her behind as he did at the Blackwater , but Stannis assures her he wo n't this time .
Stannis,She ca n't kill Stannis himself to achieve this , but as she points out , `` There are others with your blood in their veins '' - any of his brother King Robert 's bastard children who managed to survive the purge .
Stannis,She counters that it was Davos who urged Stannis not to bring her to the battle , and implies that it was actually Davos ' fault that thousands of their men burned to death , including his own son .
Stannis,She encourages Snow to take her , as the Lord of Light made humans male and female for a reason ; although clearly tempted , Jon refuses , citing his vows , and the fact that Stannis would n't approve ( to which Melisandre suggests they not tell him ) .
Stannis,She entreats him to assist Stannis in retaking Winterfell , pointing out that even if he does n't become a Stark , his familiarity with the castle could win them the battle .
Stannis,She explains as Stannis and Davos enter the room that Davos wanted a demonstration of the power in king 's blood , then removes the leeches and lights a fire in a nearby brazier .
Stannis,She is pleased , but Tyrion predicts Stannis 's imminent attack .
Stannis,She lectures Shireen on the dangers of spending time with any wildlings , since they could conceivably use Gilly to harm Stannis through Shireen .
Stannis,She weeps , and laments that she has given Stannis nothing - he does not blame her , and with pity he says that 's not true .
Stannis,Shireen 's cries become even more frightened , but Stannis continues to watch even as Selyse sobs on the ground .
Stannis,Shireen , overjoyed at her father 's declaration , runs over and gives him a hug which , after an awkward pause , Stannis returns .
Stannis,Shireen asks her father if he is ashamed of her because of her deformity ; Stannis gets up from his table and explains that not long after Shireen was born , a Dornish trader arrived on Dragonstone and , having heard of Shireen 's birth , gave a wooden doll as a gift for the newborn girl .
Stannis,Some time after Davos leaves , Stannis himself visits Shireen , visibly shaken but trying to speak to her kindly .
Stannis,Stannis Baratheon and Ser Davos visit the Iron Bank of Braavos in hopes of securing funds to aid Stannis ' war effort .
Stannis,Stannis argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory , which Stannis believes is the only way to save every man , woman and child in Westeros from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path .
Stannis,Stannis counters that it is odd that Catelyn is standing alongside Renly , given that her own husband Ned Stark rejected Renly 's initial plan to claim the throne and supported Stannis as Robert 's rightful heir , even at the cost of his own life .
Stannis,Stannis insists that it is because he needs his Hand of the King to engage in diplomacy to win Jon over - but in reality , Stannis sends Davos away so he would n't be around to stop what Stannis was planning on doing next .
Stannis,Stannis is skeptical , but Melisandre has him look into a brazier ; Stannis appears to have visions , restoring his faith in the Red Priestess .
Stannis,Stannis plans to take the Iron Throne and the road to King 's Landing passes through Winterfell , which means that Stannis also intends to take the North .
Stannis,Stannis shows Jon a message he received from Lady Lyanna Mormont in response to the demand that House Mormont pledge itself to Stannis ' cause .
Stannis,Stannis will then make Sansa the new ruler of the North , as the last ( known ) surviving Stark heir and in memory of her father Eddard 's support for Stannis .
Stannis,Still grieving , Stannis prepares to march on Winterfell .
Stannis,The Bank agrees to lend them gold , and Davos uses it to once again recruit his old pirate friend Salladhor Saan to Stannis ' cause .
Stannis,The Hound scares Sansa , but tells her to look at him , saying that since the world is made up of killers like Stannis , her father , her brother Robb , and he himself , she better get used to looking at them .
Stannis,The ensuing conflagration devastates Stannis 's fleet and destroys the ship of his high captain , Davos Seaworth , as well as killing Davos 's son , Matthos .
Stannis,The group is infuriated , but as they move in to kill him , Tormund vouches for him , describing how Rayder was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from Stannis Baratheon , and how Snow defied Stannis by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames .
Stannis,The mounted Bolton army easily defeats Stannis ' tired and mountless army .
Stannis,The next morning , Stannis 's army , with Stannis and Melisandre at its head , starts its journey to Winterfell .
Stannis,The royal couple argue over their daughter , Princess Shireen Baratheon ; Selyse believes the girl 's disfigurement is a punishment from the Lord of Light , but Stannis angrily forbids his wife from trying to physically chastise their daughter for her perceived faults .
Stannis,Their cavalry charge is led by a warrior dressed in the armor of Renly Baratheon and it decimates Stannis 's army .
Stannis,Their conversation is interrupted by Brienne , who recognizes Davos and Melisandre as Stannis ' former entourage .
Stannis,Theon holds the fort ; Arya calls in her debt with Jaqen ; Robb is betrayed ; Stannis and Davos approach their destination .
Stannis,They debate whether to align with Stannis or Renly Baratheon , but there is no agreement as Renly has greater forces , but Stannis is elder and next in line of succession ( if Cersei 's children are discounted ) .
Stannis,They have not had a significant victory since the Battle of Oxcross months ago , and the news of the Lannisters ' victory over Stannis and new alliance with the Tyrells piles bad news upon bad news .
Stannis,They hug and he embraces her tightly and Stannis whispers `` forgive me '' .
Stannis,This makes Stannis regard Jon more seriously .
Stannis,Tormund tells him that they 'll need ships to bring his people back , which Jon says he 'll borrow from Stannis .
Stannis,Varys states that Westeros is mired in chaos and on the brink of ruin ; the Seven Kingdoms requires a ruler , one stronger than Tommen yet gentler than Stannis , beloved by the people , able to please the common folk and keep the nobility in line .
Stannis,When Cersei protests she is Queen Regent and not a brood mare , Tywin angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told : she will marry Loras and in so doing , put an end to what Tywin calls `` the disgusting rumors '' Stannis has been spreading about her and Jaime .
Stannis,When Lancel comes to tell her that Stannis has reached the walls Cersei orders him to bring Joffrey back to the Red Keep , ignoring his protests that it would damage morale .
Stannis,When Melisandre insists her god is in him , Stannis releases her , realizing she is talking about the creature they created to murder his brother .
Stannis,When Stannis suggests appointing Alliser Thorne as the new commander of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea , Jon retorts that `` it is better to have your enemies close by than far away . ''
Stannis,With little else to do , Stannis takes the time to visit his wife , Queen Selyse ( who was born into House Florent ) , for the first time since returning from the battle .
Stannis,Wounded and exhausted , Stannis fights off two remaining soldiers in the aftermath of the carnage and collapses against a tree .
Stannis Baratheon,Arya spots someone behind her target , which is revealed to be Melisandre and a small group of Stannis Baratheon 's men .

Stannis Baratheon,Following his defeat at the Blackwater , Stannis Baratheon has retreated back to Dragonstone .
Stannis Baratheon,From across the courtyard , Stannis Baratheon sees Jon behead Janos for refusing his orders , and slightly nods in approval .
Stannis Baratheon,He angrily roars about how he saved King 's Landing from Stannis Baratheon 's forces and says he should 've allowed Stannis to kill everyone in King 's Landing , much to the horror and disgust of the people in the court .
Stannis Baratheon,In the library , Sam tells Gilly about his wish to go to Citadel and become a maester before he was sent to the Night 's Watch , when Stannis Baratheon walks in .

Starks,Hot Pie leaves after addressing the Starks as traitors .

Starks,Ramsay reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to House Stark 's rule of the North following Robb Stark 's death , and nearly all the Northerners , who are furious at House Bolton and House Frey 's treachery against the Starks , will rally behind Bran and Rickon rather than Roose if they learn the boys are alive .

Starks,Theon at first tells them the simple truth that he wanted to take and hold Winterfell while the North was vunerable to impress his father , then starts frantically lying , saying he hates the Starks and is their enemy , desperately trying to figure out what his captors want him to tell them .
Starks,Theon implores his father to reconsider , claiming that if the Greyjoys attack the North , they face the possibility of total destruction if they lose , but if they ally with the Starks and win , Balon will be crowned King of the Iron Islands and House Greyjoy will be awarded Casterly Rock and essentially the source of the Lannisters ' wealth along with it , but Balon rebuffs Theon and chastises him for becoming loyal to the Starks .
Starks,Tywin dismissively points out that he started a war when his hated dwarf son Tyrion was captured by the Starks , so assuredly he is willing to do even more now for his elder son .

Steelshanks,The next day , Jaime leaves Harrenhal in the company of Qyburn ( who is to accompany Jaime to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his Maester 's chain restored through Lord Tywin 's influence- Jaime jokes that his father will make Qyburn Grand Maester if he grows Jaime a new hand ) and a number of Bolton soldiers under the command of Steelshanks , one of Lord Bolton's captains .
Steelshanks,When Qyburn mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing Brienne before they die in battle or winter , Jaime , feeling guilty because his lie to protect Brienne has invertantly placed her in greater danger , urges Steelshanks to return to Harrenhal .
Stone Men,Everyone claimed Shireen would die of it sooner or later , and urged Stannis to send her to the ruins of Valyria to live out her days with the `` Stone Men '' before the disease infected the rest of the castle ; Stannis says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer , apothecary and Maester he could to save Shireen .
Stone Men,So distracted are they that they do n't notice when the statues on a nearby aqueduct stand up and leap at the boat : they are Stone Men - victims of greyscale so far gone that they have been sent to live out the rest of their lives in quarantine in the ruins .
Stone Mill,Edmure tries to at least point out that they lost only two hundred men at Stone Mill and multiple Lannister soldiers died for every man they lost , at which Robb cuts him off and shouts that they need their men more than Tywin Lannister needs his ( who already outnumber the Starks significantly ) .
Stone Mill,Instead , by successfully attacking the Lannisters at Stone Mill , Edmure kept them penned in the Riverlands , and thus close enough to King 's Landing that Tywin was able to rush to the defense of the city at the Battle of the Blackwater .

Styr,Styr picks Jon up and begins strangling him , but Jon spits blood in Styr 's face and distracts him long enough for Jon to grab the blacksmith 's hammer lying next to him and buries it in Styr 's skull .
Styr,The owl is revealed to be controlled by a Thenn warg who is a member of the garrison of wildlings under command of Tormund and Styr , who have set up camp just outside of the southern entrance to Castle Black .

Theon,However , Theon 's unidentified savior returns and snipes all of the captors from afar using his bow , rescuing him at the last minute .

Theon,Ramsay seemingly falls for it , saying that it took much longer for him to get Theon Greyjoy over to his side but that Theon told him everything , including how Osha had seduced Theon in order to help Rickon and Bran Stark escape Winterfell .

Theon,Roose gives Ramsay orders as well ; to take Theon and an army to Moat Cailin and reclaim the fortress from the Greyjoys .
Theon,Roose notes that while he has been named Warden of the North , Tywin Lannister will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn , and he had intended on trading Theon for Moat Cailin , a strategically placed fortress on the border between the North and the Riverlands currently held by Greyjoy forces , preventing the main Bolton army from returning north .

Theon,Stunned by this admission , Sansa 's anger towards Reek cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone , calling him Theon again , he breaks down and runs out the room , crying , `` Not Theon !
Theon,The boy , giving commands , is revealed to be one of the head torturers , and Theon 's entire `` escape '' that he led him on was nothing more than another form of torture , sadistically toying with him .
Theon,The boy claims he too has heard about Theon's famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part .
Theon,The boy is surprised , and Theon explains to him that Bran and Rickon escaped , so he had to fake their deaths so he would n't seem weak .

Theon,Theon implores his father to reconsider , claiming that if the Greyjoys attack the North , they face the possibility of total destruction if they lose , but if they ally with the Starks and win , Balon will be crowned King of the Iron Islands and House Greyjoy will be awarded Casterly Rock and essentially the source of the Lannisters ' wealth along with it , but Balon rebuffs Theon and chastises him for becoming loyal to the Starks .
Theon,Theon is brought to Roose 's chambers , where Roose is disgusted and angered to learn Ramsay has tortured and flayed Theon ; as Balon Greyjoy 's sole surviving male heir , Theon was a valuable hostage .

Tommen,Jaime suggests that Olenna send House Tyrell 's army to the city instead , and points out to his uncle that Tommen only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying , so Kevan would n't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the Tyrell army arrives .
Tommen,Joffrey , his brother Tommen , and Cersei laugh at the performance .
Tommen,Kevan says that Tommen expressly forbid him to use the Lannister army he commands at the city to make a move against the Great Sept , for fear that the Faith Militant will harm Margaery in retaliation .
Tommen,King Tommen recuses himself from the trial , appointing his grandfather Tywin , Prince Oberyn Martell , and Lord Mace Tyrell as judges .
Tommen,Loras points out that Joffrey is a monster , that Tommen is only eight and laughs at the notion of Robert and Renly 's other brother , Lord Stannis , ever becoming king , as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster .
Tommen,Margaery Tyrell is furious at Tommen for her brother 's arrest , then tries to manipulate him by weeping at how hurt she is that he let this happen to Loras .
Tommen,Margaery is even more upset at how ineffectual young Tommen was , so she leaves saying that she is going to bring her grandmother Olenna back to the capital to deal with this .
Tommen,Margaery mocks Cersei for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her , going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme , she does n't understand innocence and decency , which Margaery suspects is why Tommen loves her , Margaery , and was willing to send Cersei back to Casterly Rock .
Tommen,Qyburn also tells her that Tommen has become reclusive , refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state .
Tommen,Realizing this is not going to end well , Tommen meekly withdraws back to the Red Keep .
Tommen,Seeing an opportunity , Margaery manipulates Tommen into thinking that as long as Cersei stays in King 's Landing , she will continue to treat him like a child , watching over him .

Tommen,She mentions the new and prospective marriage between Margaery and the new king , Tommen .
Tommen,She promises to visit again and Tommen falls asleep smiling .
Tommen,Sitting in the Hand 's seat , she announces that `` Tommen '' has declared Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers and that the position of Hand of the King will remain vacant until Tommen is old enough to decide on a candidate for himself .
Tommen,That night , Margaery enters Tommen 's chambers , slipping past the Kingsguard and charming Tommen .
Tommen,The Kingsguard request that Tommen let them kill the Faith Militant to pass .
Tommen,The Tyrell army will surround the Great Sept , intimidating the Sparrows into releasing Margaery and Loras , without any blood actually being shed - and by the time Tommen finds out what they 've done he will already be happy with the outcome .
Tommen,The next morning , Tommen and Cersei are out for a walk .
Tommen,Tyrion Lannister arrives back in King 's Landing , to Joffrey 's disdain , but to the delight of Tommen and Myrcella who had worried that he was dead .
Tommen,Tyrion earnestly points out that her other two children , Myrcella and Tommen , are not monsters , and they share an odd moment of sympathy .
Tommen,Tywin bursts into the throne room and announces their victory , just in time to stop Cersei from killing Tommen .
Tommen,Tywin is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin Cersei reveals that all of the rumors about her and Jaime ( and their children ) are true - she will tell everyone and destroy Tywin 's vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and Tommen 's death .
Tommen,Varys states that Westeros is mired in chaos and on the brink of ruin ; the Seven Kingdoms requires a ruler , one stronger than Tommen yet gentler than Stannis , beloved by the people , able to please the common folk and keep the nobility in line .
Tommen,When Tommen asks the High Sparrow why he wants to put his mother through more trials , the Sparrow replies that he is merely carrying out the will of the Seven .
Tommen,With Cersei out of the picture , both Margaery and Tywin will attempt to get their claws into Tommen , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance .
Tommen Baratheon,Margaery replied that she wants to return to her family and her husband Tommen Baratheon .

Tormund,Mance 's plan is for Tormund 's small band to distract Castle Black by attacking their exposed southern side , at which point Mance 's main army will assault it from the north .
Tormund,Mance orders Tormund to take Jon with him , as Jon knows the layout of Castle Black , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty : if it turns out that he wo n't really betray the Night 's Watch , Tormund can easily throw him off the Wall to his death .

Tormund,Saddened , Tormund implores Jon that Ygritte 's final resting place should be in `` the real north . ''
Tormund,South of the Wall , the Thenn warg 's owl also spots the fire and informs Styr and Tormund that the time has come to attack Castle Black .
Tormund,Styr suggests that Tormund taste crow meat before he dies , as a human arm roasts over a fire .
Tormund,The group is infuriated , but as they move in to kill him , Tormund vouches for him , describing how Rayder was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from Stannis Baratheon , and how Snow defied Stannis by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames .

Trystane,She is upset for a moment , but then Doran explains his solution : his son Trystane will go along with them , to take over the seat on the Small Council which Tywin granted to Oberyn , but which was vacated by his death .
Trystane,They lounge on a circle of couches , Myrcella cuddling with Trystane .

Tully,Lord Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark arrive safely at the Bloody Gate , though Petyr has Sansa cover her hair , as auburn is widely known as a Tully trait , and introduces her as his niece , Alayne .

Tyene,Before he can give an order , Tyene stabs Areo Hotah in the back , killing him , while Ellaria stabs Doran in the chest .

Tyrell,Jaime suggests that Olenna send House Tyrell 's army to the city instead , and points out to his uncle that Tommen only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying , so Kevan would n't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the Tyrell army arrives .
Tyrell,Karstark maintains that unless Edmure has been breeding soldiers like rabbits , it will make no difference : with their new Tyrell allies , the Lannisters now outnumber them over two to one .

Tyrell,Olenna Tyrell returns to King 's Landing after learning of her grandson 's arrest .
Tyrell,Olenna first tries to bribe him , but learning that he can not be bought , threatens to end the Tyrell support for the capital by ending shipments of food .
Tyrell,One of them embroiders a golden Tyrell rose with their motto , `` Growing Strong , '' which prompts Olenna to complain that their family has the dullest sigil and motto in the Seven Kingdoms .
Tyrell,Prior to the wedding , Margaery Tyrell tries to ingratiate herself to Cersei , commenting they will technically be sisters soon ; Cersei responds by telling Margaery the story behind the `` Rains of Castamere , '' relating how it refers to the destruction of House Reyne of Castamere after their failed rebellion against House Lannister ( inferring similarities between the ambitions and position of Houses Reyne and Tyrell and that the same fate may fall upon House Tyrell if they plot against the Lannisters ) and concludes by threatening to have Margaery strangled in her sleep if she ever dares call Cersei sister again .
Tyrell,Robb shows Talisa a war map of the Seven Kingdoms - depicting Robb 's armies concentrated around Riverrun and Harrenhal , Lannister and Tyrell armies overrunning the Stormlands , Lannister/Tyrell armies concentrated in King 's Landing , and Greyjoy forces occupying the western coasts of the North .
Tyrell,Sansa confidently remarks on his fighting ability , and inquires when she and Loras will wed , as per the Tyrell plot to keep her out of the hands of Baelish and/or the Lannisters .
Tyrell,Taking King 's Landing would have been difficult to begin with , but now Tywin and the bulk of the main Lannister army , as well as a large Tyrell army , are defending the city .
Tyrell,The Tyrell army will surround the Great Sept , intimidating the Sparrows into releasing Margaery and Loras , without any blood actually being shed - and by the time Tommen finds out what they 've done he will already be happy with the outcome .
Tyrell,The thought of finally escaping Joffrey , being wed to her idol and becoming a Tyrell makes Sansa choke out tears of joy .
Tyrells,Cersei is trying to build up a new alliance between the Crown and the Faith , as a counterweight against the large political influence the Tyrells now possess .
Tyrells,Cersei realizes she has lost control of Joffrey to the Tyrells .
Tyrells,Cersei says she is afraid of the growing influence of the Tyrells at court , and something must be done about them .
Tyrells,He also notes that the Tyrells wo n't go through with their plan until after Joffrey 's wedding , which means they need to act first ... namely by finding Sansa another husband .
Tyrells,In King 's Landing , Queen Regent Cersei Lannister encounters Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish in a courtyard , and tells him she fears that the Tyrells do not have the Lannisters ' best interests at heart , but her father wo n't listen .
Tyrells,Jaime is clearly irked by Joffrey 's arrogance as well as Meryn 's sycophantic agreement with the king 's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed ( Jaime notes that this is more the doing of the Tyrells ) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war .
Tyrells,Jaime then urges the Council to allow the Tyrells to march their army into King 's Landing , crush the Faith Militant , and bring Margaery and Loras back to the Red Keep into Crown custody .
Tyrells,Mace offers that House Tyrell could front the money for the time being , but Cersei clearly does not want to give the Tyrells more power over the crown .
Tyrells,Olenna is bored to discuss financial matters , but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the Tyrells are supplying to aid the crown , demonstrating that Tyrion does n't need to lecture her about wartime expenses .
Tyrells,Olenna points out that the Tyrells have done much to supply the city with soldiers and provisions to assist in the war effort , as well as the coming winter .
Tyrells,Olenna says she will not risk `` throwing another flower into the dirt '' if Cersei can not bear heirs for the Tyrells .
Tyrells,Sansa is worried that this means the Tyrells will cancel their proposed marriage alliance ( meaning Sansa will be stuck with Joffrey again ) , but Olenna assures her that her son Mace is too intent on Margaery entering into a royal marriage to cancel it for anything .
Tyrells,Sansa warns the Tyrells that Joffrey is a monster .
Tyrells,The Tyrells ( Margaery , Olenna , Mace , and Loras ) , as well as Varys , Prince Oberyn , Tywin , Tyrion , and Sansa Stark , make little effort to hide their disgust .
Tyrells,Theon Greyjoy murdered Robb 's younger brothers at Winterfell , which makes Sansa Robb 's heir : if he dies , rule of Winterfell and the North goes to her and any man she marries ... which Tywin has no intention of letting the Tyrells get their hands on .
Tyrells,Therefore , even though Tywin admits the Lannisters can trust nobody except themselves , they need the Tyrells ' wealth and resources on their side .
Tyrells,They have not had a significant victory since the Battle of Oxcross months ago , and the news of the Lannisters ' victory over Stannis and new alliance with the Tyrells piles bad news upon bad news .
Tyrells,Tyrion questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match , but Tywin points out that as a plot against them , the Tyrells ' plan is , by definition , a secret , thus the Lannisters ca n't be said to be `` refusing '' them something which they are n't officially trying to do .
Tyrells,Tywin explains that the Tyrells are plotting to wed Sansa to Ser Loras and states that he will not allow them to steal `` the key to the north '' out from under him .
Tyrells,Tywin replies that if that is true , he has no right to the throne and the Tyrells just `` threw a flower into the dirt '' .

Tyrion,At this point , Tyrion is finally close enough to release the locking pin on the second dragon 's collar .
Tyrion,Baelish says he hopes Tyrion does well in the position , as he owes him for securing the release of Ros ( after Cersei arrested her , mistaking her for Shae ) but Tyrion says it was just a misunderstanding .

Tyrion,Eddard says that Tyrion was arrested on his orders .
Tyrion,Egen is unwilling to fight Tyrion however , as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable .

Tyrion,From the battlements , Joffrey berates Tyrion , demanding to know why his ships are not meeting Stannis 's fleet .
Tyrion,Given that Lysa 's son is a young boy and would n't make a good judge in a formal trial , Tyrion instead demands a trial by combat , which Lysa also reluctantly agrees is his right .
Tyrion,Given that he is half the world away from Daenerys , he also accurately deduces that she must have found out he was spying on her and had him exiled - and therefore , he kidnapped Tyrion in the hope that presenting him as a gift to Daenerys will get him back in her favor .
Tyrion,Grey Worm , still recovering from his injuries , offers to go with Jorah and Daario , as does Tyrion .
Tyrion,He also insists she take Podrick Payne with her as a squire , both as a reward for the boy 's service to Tyrion and to keep him safe from those who would seek to use him against his former master .
Tyrion,He also offers Oberyn a position on the Small Council , if Oberyn agrees to be the third judge at Tyrion 's trial .
Tyrion,He also orders Tyrion to leave his whore behind .
Tyrion,He also states that he 's not Joffrey , Tyrion would rather bide his time and humiliate them .
Tyrion,He and Jon share a moment of fellowship before Tyrion departs for the capital in the company of Yoren .
Tyrion,He attempts to defuse the situation by telling Tyrion that despite this , Tyrion has stubbornly clung to life , which Tywin states he finds admirable and insists that he was never going to have Tyrion actually killed .
Tyrion,He can not speak to Bronn either because , as a close associate of Tyrion , he is also under investigation .

Tyrion,He looks at Tyrion and then glances in the direction of Meereen , knowing that even if he dies , he needs to get Tyrion to Daenerys .
Tyrion,He orders Tyrion to lead them from the front of the vanguard .
Tyrion,He promptly begins to slash at Tyrion 's gift despite its rarity , and then asks for suggestions on its name from guests in attendance .
Tyrion,He realizes that it 's Ser Gregor Clegane , `` The Mountain '' , who is likely under Lannister orders to punish the Riverlands - which are held by House Tully , the former House of his wife Catelyn , who now holds Tyrion captive .
Tyrion,He refuses to fight the Mountain ( whom Cersei has chosen for her champion ) , both for lack of a reward and believing Clegane is too dangerous for him to face , and bids farewell to Tyrion , who while heartbroken by Bronn 's decision , understands .
Tyrion,He reminds Tyrion that he has experience running a city full of people trying to kill each other , and implies that he - and his little birds - are there to help .
Tyrion,He tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with Tyrion - and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for Essos to build a new , lavish life for herself .
Tyrion,He then advises Tyrion to go and drink until it feels like he did the right thing .

Tyrion,He wakes up to find that Hodor has brought the finished saddle designed by Tyrion .
Tyrion,Her offer of a lordship for Tyrion 's head has indeed motivated people to start killing any dwarf they can find and try to pass it off as Tyrion .
Tyrion,However , Tyrion is concerned his mistress is n't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife , a mistress and the entire North despising him .
Tyrion,However , Tyrion uses the opportunity of his audience in front of Lysa 's court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial , and Lysa is shamed into agreeing .
Tyrion,However , as Tyrion is tied up , he is cornered at one end of the boat with a stone man advancing on him while Jorah battles more at the other end .
Tyrion,However , once out of Tyrion 's view , he pulls back his sleeve to inspect the cracked skin on his wrist , confirming that he had been infected with greyscale during the fight with the stone men .
Tyrion,However , when he attempts to stand , Tyrion steadies the crossbow , stopping him dead in his tracks .
Tyrion,Immediately after leaving , Tyrion returns to his chambers and calls for Sansa , who simply regards him with a forlorn , tear-streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family 's death .

Tyrion,Impressed with her instincts , Baelish admits that Tyrion is in fact innocent , and reveals Sansa 's own part in Joffrey 's death - Ser Dontos ' necklace was in fact the murder weapon , and someone slipped a stone ( which was poisonous ) into Joffrey 's wine .

Tyrion,In their meeting chambers , Yezzan marvels at how Tyrion went from being a nearly-worthless slave to the de facto ruler of Meereen .

Tyrion,Intending to start his revenge with Gregor Clegane , Oberyn offers his service as Tyrion 's champion in the coming trial by combat .
Tyrion,It also comes out that Tyrion had sex with Ros back in the North , though Tyrion points out it was before he met Shae .
Tyrion,It is n't clear if anyone in the room , including Tywin or Joffrey , think that Tyrion 's outburst was simply due to being very drunk , but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass .
Tyrion,Jaime curtly says that Varys did ( when in fact , Jaime forced Varys to help him free Tyrion ) .

Tyrion,Jaime has heard of Tyrion 's arrest and demands an explanation .
Tyrion,Jaime has hired three more prostitutes for Tyrion , to hurry things along .
Tyrion,Jaime is perturbed that people will find out that he can not fight so Tyrion tells him that he needs to train with his left hand with someone trustworthy in order to better protect the king , as the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard .
Tyrion,Jaime ponders why Tywin would risk so much for the ugly , stunted son that he hates , but to Tywin a Lannister is a Lannister - even though he considers Tyrion the least worthy member of their family , any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak .
Tyrion,Jaime tells Tyrion , a man of limited height but with immense appetites , that he will be needed at the feast that night .
Tyrion,Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei offers a knighthood to whomever captures Sansa Stark .

Tyrion,Jorah asks how he could have known his father Jeor Mormont , but Tyrion explains he visited the Wall once and met him : he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men , a rare thing in the world , but now as the eulogy for Night 's Watch members goes , `` the world will not see his like again . ''
Tyrion,Jorah asks how he died : Tyrion says he only knows the report he heard , which said that his father led an expedition beyond the Wall , but there was a mutiny , and Jeor was murdered by his own men .
Tyrion,Jorah smacks Tyrion across the face , quieting him down .
Tyrion,Jorah tells Tyrion not to let them touch him and fights them off .
Tyrion,Jorah will not volunteer any information about himself , but from a few observations ( such as the bear sigil on his armor ) , Tyrion quickly surmises that he must be Jorah Mormont .
Tyrion,Just before the stone man is able to grab him , Tyrion rolls off of the boat and into the water to escape , where he is then pulled down by more stone men under the water .

Tyrion,Later that night she had sex with Tyrion , the first time he was ever with a woman .
Tyrion,Later when they are at sea , Tyrion urges for Jorah to remove his gag .
Tyrion,Littlefinger says it was the safest place to keep such records , but Tyrion notes that his brothel has n't been the safest place for bastards .
Tyrion,Lysa immediately calms down and comforts Sansa , assuring her that she believes her , and that since neither Tyrion nor Petyr had slept with her , Sansa can proceed to marry Robin .
Tyrion,Lysa is furious that Cat has endangered them all by bringing Tyrion to the Vale .
Tyrion,Lysa laments Sansa 's treatment in King 's Landing , ignoring her attempts to defend Tyrion 's character .
Tyrion,Lysa summons Tyrion , believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit , but all he confesses to is being a liar , a whoremonger , and a player of practical jokes .
Tyrion,Mandon slashes Tyrion across the face with his sword .
Tyrion,Margaery Tyrell consoles Sansa , reminding her that Tyrion is far from the worst Lannister and that Tyrion might be able to make her happy , given his skill as a lover .
Tyrion,Margaery insists that Olenna can not be certain of Tyrion 's innocence , but Olenna states that Tyrion certainly is innocent and confesses that she would never have let Margaery marry `` that beast . ''
Tyrion,Marillion draws the attention of Tyrion to Catelyn 's table , by offering to serenade him while he eats , singing of his father 's military victories .
Tyrion,Meanwhile , Tyrion passes the time by engaging Missandei and Grey Worm in small talk .
Tyrion,Missandei and Grey Worm tell Tyrion that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating ever since Daenerys left .
Tyrion,Nonetheless , he leads Tyrion out of the castle to the docks where Tyrion is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship .
Tyrion,Now completely enraged , Joffrey bellows that as king , he can do whatever he pleases , but Tyrion again coldly counters that the Mad King thought he could do as he pleased too , which led to him being overthrown and killed .
Tyrion,Oberyn dismisses Tyrion 's concerns , noting that he always drinks before a fight and favors speed over protection .
Tyrion,Oberyn says that he and Elia were quite disturbed at Cersei 's already strong hatred toward Tyrion , who is disturbed by Cersei 's relentless hatred as his eyes tear up .
Tyrion,Oberyn tells Tyrion that he saw no monster , just a baby .
Tyrion,Oberyn tells Tyrion that he seeks justice for the death of his sister , and Tyrion replies , `` You are in the wrong place . ''
Tyrion,Oberyn visits Tyrion in his cell .
Tyrion,Olenna is bored to discuss financial matters , but quickly lists off specific details of the soldiers and supplies the Tyrells are supplying to aid the crown , demonstrating that Tyrion does n't need to lecture her about wartime expenses .
Tyrion,Once inside the Sept , she chastises her brother Jaime for freeing their brother Tyrion and indirectly causing their father 's death .
Tyrion,One of the dragons emerges from the shadows and Tyrion maintains eye contact .
Tyrion,Over a meal , Jaime and Tyrion discuss Jaime 's gilded steel hand , and he discloses to Tyrion that he can no longer fight , as all of his instincts are wrong using his left hand .
Tyrion,Petyr Baelish is furious about being involved in Tyrion 's deception .
Tyrion,Pod confirms that there has been no word of Shae , which Tyrion takes as good news .
Tyrion,Pod has been asked to compile a list of Tyrion 's witnesses .
Tyrion,Podrick reveals how he killed Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard by shoving a spear through his head when he tried to kill Tyrion during the Battle of the Blackwater .
Tyrion,Podrick then returns , with the money Tyrion gave him to pay the prostitutes .
Tyrion,Privately , Cersei meets with Tyrion and expresses regret at having children with her own brother Jaime .
Tyrion,Quickly Tyrion gains the favor of a sellsword , Bronn , who agrees to give his room to Tyrion .
Tyrion,Realizing that returning to the castle is likely unsafe , Varys turns around and heads back for the ship , sitting next to Tyrion 's crate in silence as they cast off for Essos .
Tyrion,Reluctantly , Tyrion explains that when he was very young , he and Jaime were out riding near Casterly Rock and found a young common girl in distress from bandits .
Tyrion,Reluctantly impressed by Tyrion 's astute judgment of the situation , Tywin orders his son to go to King 's Landing and serve as Acting Hand of the King in Tywin 's stead .
Tyrion,Robb very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the Watch , silently letting Tyrion know he is not invited to stay at Winterfell .
Tyrion,Sansa and Tyrion attempt to leave the feast , while Margaery serves Joffrey a piece of pie .
Tyrion,Sansa defends Tyrion , with an innate certainty that he is innocent , and mentions that Baelish is far too smart to trust a drunk with the scheme .
Tyrion,Sansa hands the goblet to Tyrion , and he fills it with wine and hands it back to Joffrey .
Tyrion,Several witnesses are called for the prosecution , including Ser Meryn Trant , Grand Maester Pycelle , Queen Regent Cersei , and Varys , all of whom give testimony backing the accusations against Tyrion .
Tyrion,Shae confirms that she is in love with Tyrion and that she cares deeply for Sansa as well , but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses , Shae will not leave until or unless Tyrion asks her to .
Tyrion,Shae pleads to stay , but Tyrion says he is married and it is too dangerous for her to stay .
Tyrion,Shae points out that Tyrion was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped .
Tyrion,Shae urges Tyrion to leave with her for Pentos , but he refuses .
Tyrion,She asks Tyrion which one of them should be the one to break the news to Sansa .
Tyrion,She asks Tyrion why she should n't kill him , since the Lannisters are enemies to her House .
Tyrion,She is out for Tyrion 's blood , and he says that the trial is even worse because at least one judge has always wanted him dead .
Tyrion,She is pleased , but Tyrion predicts Stannis 's imminent attack .
Tyrion,She is suspicious that Tyrion is taking power for himself , but he convinces her that he is there to act as an advisor .
Tyrion,She orders him sent to the sky cells , three-sided cells with the fourth open to a sheer drop down the mountainside , forcing Tyrion to huddle in a corner and try not to roll out to his death in his sleep .
Tyrion,She tells the judges of Tyrion 's sexual desires , embarrassing him in front of the crowd .
Tyrion,She testifies that Tyrion and Sansa planned Joffrey 's murder together , claiming that Sansa wanted vengeance for the murder of her father , mother , and brother .
Tyrion,She tries to ensure his safety by kidnapping the prostitute Ros , believing that she is Tyrion 's lover .
Tyrion,Sick of the carriage they 've been riding in , Tyrion again dismisses the dangers and insists they leave to explore .
Tyrion,So Tyrion arranges for two prostitutes from Littlefinger 's brothel , Ros and Daisy , to entertain Joffrey .
Tyrion,Spotting a slaver ship in the distance , Jorah pulls Tyrion to the ground .
Tyrion,Taking the hint , Tyrion visibly swallows his anger and begins to act far more drunk than he actually is , intentionally humiliating himself , and says he only made a bad joke .
Tyrion,Teasing Tyrion about abandoning him in Volantis , he is pleased to see Tyrion already settling into a role that suits him .
Tyrion,The Hound is judged by the gods ; Jaime is judged ; Jon proves himself ; Robb is betrayed ; Tyrion learns the cost of weddings .
Tyrion,The Sons of the Harpy routed for now , Daario , Jorah , Missandei and Tyrion look on in astonishment as Drogon soars away .
Tyrion,The Tyrells ( Margaery , Olenna , Mace , and Loras ) , as well as Varys , Prince Oberyn , Tywin , Tyrion , and Sansa Stark , make little effort to hide their disgust .
Tyrion,The ceremony is a grim affair ; Joffrey smugly escorts Sansa to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which Tyrion was to stand on to cloak Sansa in Lannister colors as part of the ceremony , eliciting snickers from the congregation ( though the scowl of Lord Tywin quickly silences them ) .
Tyrion,The dragons retreat , and Tyrion hastily returns to Varys .
Tyrion,The emissaries are Tyrion 's former slave master Yezzan zo Qaggaz , the Yunkai'i Wise Master Razdal mo Eraz and the Volantene triarch Belicho Paenymion .
Tyrion,The following morning , Shae notices with a hint of a smile that Sansa 's bed sheets are not stained with blood and Tyrion 's virgin bride is still a virgin .
Tyrion,The freedmen do not trust Tyrion , a foreigner and a newcomer , and look to Grey Worm and Missandei for reassurance .
Tyrion,The king demands that Tyrion kneel before him but Tyrion refuses .
Tyrion,The moment Tywin utters the word `` whore '' again , Tyrion looses his crossbow bolt , hitting Tywin in the belly and knocking him backwards .
Tyrion,The other advances on him , then gingerly turns his head to the side so Tyrion can free him as well .
Tyrion,The parties depart Winterfell : Jon , Tyrion and Benjen Stark to the Wall ; and Eddard , Arya , Sansa and the royal party south to King 's Landing .
Tyrion,The relieved woman accepts Tyrion 's generosity .
Tyrion,The royal party 's guards are soon overwhelmed , and Joffrey , Cersei and Tyrion barely make it back to the castle unscathed .
Tyrion,The short joyful moments for Tyrion and Jaime are shattered , as Tywin stands and proclaims the will of the gods is clear : Tyrion is guilty and sentenced to death .
Tyrion,The singer turns out to be Marillion , who Catelyn and Ser Rodrik met at the Inn at the Crossroads , and who accompanied them and Tyrion to the Vale of Arryn .
Tyrion,The streets of the capital city are overflowing with starving refugees from the War of the Five Kings , as Cersei ignored both Tyrion and Janos Slynt 's earlier warnings that something had to be done to care for the starving peasants or there would be mounting discontent with her son 's rule .
Tyrion,The topic of just why Tyrion was even in Volantis comes up , and Tyrion is surprised that Jorah did not ask earlier : he explains that he actually fled from Westeros because he killed his own father Tywin .
Tyrion,They all laughed , then Tyrion 's father told him dragons were extinct , and Tyrion says he cried himself to sleep that night .
Tyrion,They discuss the role of Varys in their stories and Tyrion assures Daenerys he trusts him , and that he 's probably the reason she was n't killed years ago .
Tyrion,They eagerly agree , and escort Tyrion and Bronn westwards towards where the Lannister armies are gathering .
Tyrion,They ended up getting drunk at a local inn , and she became so enamored of him that Tyrion felt like he was n't an ugly dwarf .
Tyrion,They have had word from King 's Landing about Eddard 's injury , Jory 's death and Tyrion 's capture .
Tyrion,This comes as a shock , because his older brother Jaime gave up all right to inherit his father 's lands when he joined the Kingsguard , and Tyrion is rightfully the next in line of succession .
Tyrion,This enrages everyone in the court and Tywin orders Ser Meryn to escort Tyrion back to the dungeons .
Tyrion,Though not in the circumstances they hoped , Tyrion and Jorah are once again quickly heading towards Meereen and Queen Daenerys .
Tyrion,To Tyrion 's astonishment , it contains an elderly sorcerer , the very same one that castrated Varys so many years ago .
Tyrion,To Tyrion 's surprise , Kinvara appears to be highly accommodating in supporting Tyrion 's goals , as she firmly believes that Daenerys is The Prince That Was Promised .
Tyrion,To calm them , Tyrion speaks gently , explaining that some say that dragons are more intelligent than humans , and tells about about a time when he was little and had asked his uncle for a dragon - not even a large one , just a little one like him .
Tyrion,To that end , Tyrion invites Kinvara , High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis , to negotiate spreading the word of Daenerys 's accomplishments .
Tyrion,Traveling north , Jon and Tyrion talk , and Tyrion reveals that he reads books to sharpen his mind , his greatest asset and weapon .
Tyrion,Tyrion also passes a street protest that blames him for the ills of the city , as they believe Tyrion to be manipulating Joffrey .
Tyrion,Tyrion and Bronn enter , and Oberyn and Tyrion step outside to speak privately .
Tyrion,Tyrion and Bronn then lead Pod into another room of the brothel , where Tyrion says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the Battle of the Blackwater : he has paid for Podrick ( who has never had sex with a woman ) to enjoy the services of not one , but three prostitutes : Marei , Genna , and a contortionist named Kayla ( one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a `` Meereenese Knot '' ) .
Tyrion,Tyrion and Varys go down below the pyramid , with Tyrion advancing into the darkness alone .
Tyrion,Tyrion can not even reply , shockingly staring in catatonic astonishment at Oberyn 's skull-crushed corpse , as does Jaime ; the only different reaction is from Cersei , who stares at Oberyn 's slaughtered body , listening to Tyrion 's death sentence while smirking in vindication .
Tyrion,Tyrion can not outmaneuver Olenna , but in the end she decides on her own that she wo n't have it said House Tyrell is n't doing its part to help , so she agrees to pay for half the cost of the festivities , for which Tyrion is grateful .
Tyrion,Tyrion desperately asks for volunteers , and after a long pause during which it seems that Tyrion 's cause is lost , the sellsword Bronn steps forward and says he will stand for him .
Tyrion,Tyrion discards the crossbow as he leaves to find Varys , who immediately realizes Tyrion has done something terrible , exclaiming `` What have you done ? ''
Tyrion,Tyrion flatly refuses , but Tywin points out that recently he was complaining that he was n't rewarded for his actions in the Battle of the Blackwater , and as heiress to the North , Sansa is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is long past time Tyrion was we
Tyrion,Tyrion gently instructs Lancel that he wo n't tell , but from now on , Lancel must report everything Cersei does back to Tyrion .
Tyrion,Tyrion has descended into bitterness and self-loathing , seemingly determined to drink himself to death , but Varys angrily snaps him out of his self pity , telling Tyrion that he still has talents that may yet be of use ; talents that he could use to seat the right candidate on the Iron Throne .
Tyrion,Tyrion manages to knock the knife from her hands and the two continue to struggle violently until Tyrion manages to grab the necklace around her throat ( which he once gave her as a gift ) and strangles her with it .
Tyrion,Tyrion overhears this and looks vexed , but proceeds to approach Joffrey and Podrick Payne , Tyrion 's squire , presents him with the Lives of Four Kings , a book detailing the reigns of four kings by Grand Maester Kaeth .
Tyrion,Tyrion points out that if Baelish departs for the Vale that leaves a vacancy on the Small Council , and Tywin reveals that he has appointed Tyrion as the new Master of Coin to replace him .
Tyrion,Tyrion realizes that it was in fact Joffrey who ordered Ser Mandon Moore to kill him , because Tyrion was the only one who stood up to him .
Tyrion,Tyrion then says that Shae will not leave King 's Landing and is warned that Tywin has threatened to hang the next whore Tyrion is seen with .
Tyrion,Tyrion tries to protest , pointing out that Joffrey has made Sansa 's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force Tyrion on her after she has finally escaped Joffrey is cruel , even by Tywin 's standards .
Tyrion,Tywin Lannister bluntly tells his son Tyrion that he intends to disinherit him .
Tyrion,Tywin accepts , telling Jaime that Tyrion will be allowed to join the Night 's Watch after being found guilty of Joffrey 's murder , provided he pleads for mercy .
Tyrion,Tywin accepts the aid of the hill tribesmen , but Shagga will only fight if Tyrion fights alongside them , a prospect which Tywin welcomes and terrifies Tyrion .
Tyrion,Tywin again waxes poetic about family , noting Tyrion 's failure to consummate his marriage to Sansa .
Tyrion,Tywin balks that Tyrion wo n't kill his own father in the privy , and again tries to convince Tyrion that they should continue to discuss this in his chambers .
Tyrion,Tywin brings up Oberyn 's knowledge of poisons and the link between that and Joffrey 's death - as some say the King was poisoned - and wonders whether Oberyn had helped Tyrion .
Tyrion,Tywin dares Tyrion by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying `` because you 're afraid of a dead whore ? ''
Tyrion,Tywin dismisses the rest of the council , save Tyrion , who drily notes that the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms has been sent to bed without his supper .
Tyrion,Tywin dismissively points out that he started a war when his hated dwarf son Tyrion was captured by the Starks , so assuredly he is willing to do even more now for his elder son .
Tyrion,Tywin interrupts Oberyn Martell and his group sex act with Ellaria Sand and Olyvar to discuss Tyrion 's up-coming trial for the murder of Joffrey .
Tyrion,Tywin is incredulous that Tyrion actually had the courage to fight back against him , and that he will die in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son .
Tyrion,Tywin is particularly insulted that Tyrion brought his mistress , Shae , to the capital when Tywin explicitly told him not to , which makes Tywin convince himself that Tyrion was in bed with Shae most of the time while events spiraled out of control .
Tyrion,Tywin questions if Tyrion plans to mistreat Sansa and asserts that he is not concerned with the girl 's happiness and neither should his son .
Tyrion,Tywin retorts that he did exactly that on the day that Tyrion was born : he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea , but instead he spared him and raised him as his son , because he is a Lannister .
Tyrion,Tywin says that the laws of men say he has to let Tyrion use his family name , but that he wishes he could prove Tyrion was n't his son , so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name `` Lannister '' which he stole from Tywin .
Tyrion,Tywin scoffs at Tyrion 's claims and says he is not on trial for being a dwarf .
Tyrion,Tywin seems surprised to see Tyrion , but quickly regains composure and asks Tyrion to lower the crossbow .
Tyrion,Tywin tells his son Tyrion that he means to use the hill tribe forces to give them an edge against the Stark army , essentially to be used as cannon fodder .
Tyrion,Tywin then instructed his guards to have sex with her , with her being paid a silver coin for each man , while Tyrion was forced to watch .
Tyrion,Undeterred , Shae starts undressing Tyrion , and asks him for a favor ; to protect Sansa from Baelish .
Tyrion,Using his own life as an example , Varys thus urges Tyrion to be patient , and his revenge will come to him in time .
Tyrion,Using this information , Tyrion asks Varys to use his little birds to send them a message .
Tyrion,Varys , Tyrion and Missandei converge to prepare for their meeting .
Tyrion,Varys and Tyrion are seen walking through the city .
Tyrion,Varys and Tyrion walking through Meereen .
Tyrion,Varys is convinced that Tyrion is the last hope for the Seven Kingdoms ' current regime , therefore Shae is a weakness that Tyrion , and thus the realm , can not afford .
Tyrion,Varys nearly loses Tyrion , but finds him observing the sermon of a Red Priestess .
Tyrion,Varys offers Tyrion the choice of either drinking himself to death in Pentos , or travelling with him to Meereen to support Daenerys Targaryen .
Tyrion,Varys points out that Tyrion was an effective ruler when he was acting Hand of the King , and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities ( a eunuch and a dwarf ) .
Tyrion,Varys reveals a conspiracy to Tyrion .
Tyrion,Varys tells Tyrion that he and Illyrio Mopatis had worked together in secret to restore House Targaryen to the rule of Westeros , but that their errors have left them in Pentos , unable to return to King 's Landing .
Tyrion,Varys tells Tyrion that he is all that stands between them and defeat .
Tyrion,Varys testifies at Tyrion 's trial
Tyrion,Varys thanks Tyrion for his part in defending the city , noting that no one else will do so .
Tyrion,Varys then tells him that Catelyn also no longer holds Tyrion as her prisoner , meaning that the Starks have nothing to barter with for Eddard 's life .
Tyrion,Varys visits and tells him that Bronn has been relieved of his command of the gold cloaks and his hill tribesmen have gone home with their plunder ; Tyrion has lost all of his power .
Tyrion,Watching over the new recruits with Lord Commander Jeor Mormont , Tyrion notes Thorne 's stern and unusual ways , but Jeor does n't care as he only requires Thorne to turn the `` thieves and runaways '' into men of the Night 's Watch .
Tyrion,When Bran arrives , Tyrion sympathizes with Bran for being a cripple , which annoys Bran , as does asking him if he likes to ride , but Tyrion simply says it is the truth , no less so for being a hard truth .
Tyrion,When Daenerys asks how he can get her what she wants , Tyrion nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the Iron Throne .
Tyrion,When Joffrey keeps pushing the matter , Tyrion slams his dagger into the table and threatens that Joffrey will `` be fucking [ his ] own bride with a wooden cock '' if he does n't let it drop .
Tyrion,When Joffrey refuses , saying the boy means nothing to him , Tyrion slaps him three times until he accepts his uncle 's suggestion .
Tyrion,When Jon angrily asks Tyrion what he knows about it , Tyrion replies that `` all dwarfs are bastards in their father 's eyes . ''
Tyrion,When Robin asks if he can make the little man fly now , Tyrion says , `` This little man is going home . ''
Tyrion,When Sansa questions what he will do if she never does , Tyrion sarcastically jokes `` And so my watch begins '' - implying that his marriage will be celibate for all time like a brother of the Night 's Watch - and then abruptly passes out on a nearby couch .
Tyrion,When Ser Meryn tries to support the king , Tyrion silences the Kingsguard by ordering Bronn to kill Meryn if the knight opens his mouth again .
Tyrion,When Shae starts to question Tyrion , Bronn reveals that he heard Tyrion was once married .
Tyrion,When Tyrion arrives with a letter from Lord Tywin , appointing him as acting Hand of the King in Tywin 's stead , Cersei becomes livid .
Tyrion,When Tyrion asks if he saw it sail away , Bronn assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her , that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and Varys .
Tyrion,When Tyrion asks why his father is doing this , Tywin is shocked as if Tyrion insulted him , and says it should be obvious as Tyrion `` killed '' his mother Joanna in childbirth so that he might enter the world .
Tyrion,When Tyrion explains that he is able to empathize with slaves because he spent one day as a slave , Missandei counters that he has not experienced slavery .
Tyrion,When Tyrion later asks Bronn if she is gone , he says that she boarded the ship .
Tyrion,When Tyrion mentions what a horrible father Tywin was , Daenerys admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father .
Tyrion,When Tyrion retorts that such a man does not exist , Varys points out that he never said this ruler would be a man .
Tyrion,When she turns over and sees that it is Tyrion , looking utterly betrayed , she grabs a knife to defend herself .
Tyrion,When the other emerges , Tyrion puts down his torch and gently advances .
Tyrion,When told there are n't any rooms , Tyrion holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him .

Tyrion,While the rulers of Meereen enjoy a tenuous peace , Tyrion reminds them of the need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys 's blessing , as the Masters could use Tyrion and Varys 's foreign status against them to reclaim Slaver 's Bay .
Tyrion,While this may seem like giving Tyrion a position of relative power again , Tyrion quickly points out that he has no prior experience in finance .
Tyrion,`` All my life you 've wanted me dead , '' Tyrion states , and Tywin acknowledges the validity of his claim .

Tyrion Lannister,They are interrupted by Yoren , who has ridden non-stop from the Crossroads Inn to bring Eddard forewarning of Catelyn 's arrest of Tyrion Lannister .
Tyrion Lannister,They are surprised when Tyrion Lannister and Yoren arrive .
Tysha,At this , Tyrion snarls that he was wed , referring to his past marriage to Tysha , asking if his father has forgotten that .
Tysha,While Jaime chased the bandits off , Tyrion comforted the girl , whose name was Tysha .
Tywin,A disconcerted Joffrey changes the subject to Daenerys Targaryen ; Tywin is surprised that Joffrey even knows about the exiled princess .

Tywin,After Robert's victory at the Trident he marched on the capital city , but Jaime 's father Tywin arrived there first , leading the entire Lannister army , and promising to defend the city .

Tywin,After asking Tywin about his own father , Tywin sends her to fetch more firewood .

Tywin,At Tywin 's wake , Cersei is approached by Lancel Lannister .
Tywin,At a meeting of the Small Council , Tywin informs the councilors that Tyrion 's trial will begin that afternoon .
Tywin,At recess , Jaime asks Tywin to spare Tyrion , offering to break his oath to the Kingsguard and return to Casterly Rock , to be his heir .
Tywin,Attacking the capital head-on would be suicide , and Tywin would crush them within a day .
Tywin,Baelish discusses with Tywin the possibility of forming an alliance between House Lannister and House Tyrell .
Tywin,Baelish points out that Tywin is dead , Jaime is one-handed and politically useless , and that Cersei is about to be forced into the background by Margaery , who is quite fond of Sansa .
Tywin,Before taking his leave Tywin smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten Joffrey squirming on the Iron Throne .
Tywin,Bronn says that if Jaime ever sees Tyrion again Jaime should give him his regards ; Jaime angrily says that if he sees his brother again , he 's going to split him in two for murdering their father Tywin .
Tywin,Cersei and Jaime adjust to a world without Tywin .
Tywin,Cersei and Tywin plot the Crown 's next move .
Tywin,Cersei approaches Tywin and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to Ser Loras Tyrell .
Tywin,Cersei flatly refuses , but Tywin is insistent : the marriages of Cersei and Tyrion will place the North and the Reach firmly in the Lannisters ' control .
Tywin,Cersei kissing her deceased father Tywin .
Tywin,Cersei points out that ( as she is next in line of succession ) maybe Tywin should consider her the real heir to his legacy , not his sons .
Tywin,Cersei suggests coming to some arrangement with one of their representatives , but Tywin dismisses the idea , since the Bank is a monolithic structure that can not be avoided , lied to or swayed .
Tywin,Cersei tells him his life is not in danger from Joffrey , as he dare not try anything like that now that Tywin is the Hand .
Tywin,Considering that Tywin did n't stop to negotiate when his own eldest son was captured , taking his younger nephews hostage will have no impact on the war .
Tywin,Daenerys is curious about the circumstances of Tyrion 's murder of Tywin .
Tywin,Enraged , Tywin orders Gregor to burn out villages and farms in reprisal for this assassination attempt .
Tywin,For that matter , despite all evidence to the contrary , Tywin refuses to believe that Tyrion was in any way helpful in the defense of the city or during his months as acting Hand of the King .
Tywin,Furious at Jaime 's disobedience and lack of ambition , Tywin rebuffs him .
Tywin,Grand Maester Pycelle , who is most focused on survival by avoiding direct conflict , does n't try to fight over a better seat with either of them , instead quietly taking the third seat away from Tywin .
Tywin,He also opines that as Tywin is dead , no one will force Cersei to marry him anymore .
Tywin,He also warns Pod to be aware of his surroundings and watch out for `` They , '' `` They '' being the spies of Tywin , Cersei , Varys or more or less anyone else .
Tywin,He attempts to defuse the situation by telling Tyrion that despite this , Tyrion has stubbornly clung to life , which Tywin states he finds admirable and insists that he was never going to have Tyrion actually killed .
Tywin,He blames Tywin for their losses in the war and the capture of Jaime .
Tywin,He correctly deduces that Jaime helped Tyrion escape his cell , telling Tyrion that they can discuss the matter back in Tywin 's chambers .
Tywin,He enters the Hand of the King 's quarters , and sees a woman lying in Tywin 's bed , with Tywin 's clothes folded up on a chair .
Tywin,He is stunned and concerned by her actions , asking how Tywin reacted to the news , but she states that she does not want to discuss their father .
Tywin,He wants Gregor Clegane , who murdered Elia , and Tywin , whom Oberyn believes gave the order for Elia and her children to be killed .
Tywin,However , Robb does not find the decisive victory he was hoping for : Tywin withdrew his garrison to King 's Landing to counter the attack by Stannis , and did n't even bother wasting any men on a token defense of the castle .
Tywin,However , Tywin says that Roose can keep it , because the title alone is enough to give Littlefinger the social standing to be a suitor to Lady Lysa Arryn .
Tywin,However , two weeks later his father Tywin found out , and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner .
Tywin,In Tywin 's chambers Grand Maester Pycelle dithers over giving Tyrion a coded message from Lord Frey .
Tywin,In frustration , Robb launches a new offensive to the east which takes the great castle of Harrenhal , which Tywin had been using it as the main Lannister forward base in the Riverlands during the first year of the war .
Tywin,In the present , Cersei arrives at the Great Sept of Baelor to pay respect to her deceased father Tywin .
Tywin,Instead , Tywin obstinately maintains his belief that Tyrion is a whore-mongering , drunken , `` ill-made , spiteful little creature , '' and that he is lying about all of his accomplishments out of envy .
Tywin,Instead , by successfully attacking the Lannisters at Stone Mill , Edmure kept them penned in the Riverlands , and thus close enough to King 's Landing that Tywin was able to rush to the defense of the city at the Battle of the Blackwater .
Tywin,It is n't clear if anyone in the room , including Tywin or Joffrey , think that Tyrion 's outburst was simply due to being very drunk , but everyone plays along anyway to help the tension pass .
Tywin,Jaime again begged Aerys to surrender , but the Mad King ordered Jaime to bring him Tywin 's head , and his pyromancer to set the city ablaze , burning its hundreds of thousands of inhabitants with wildfire .
Tywin,Jaime ponders why Tywin would risk so much for the ugly , stunted son that he hates , but to Tywin a Lannister is a Lannister - even though he considers Tyrion the least worthy member of their family , any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak .
Tywin,Jaime tries to smooth-talk Locke once again with offers of how his father Tywin will make him extravagantly rich if he lets Jaime go .
Tywin,Joffrey challenges Tywin .
Tywin,Joffrey goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather , deriding Tywin as a coward who hid under Casterly Rock while Joffrey 's father King Robert won the real war when he overthrew the Targaryens .
Tywin,Joffrey is puzzled at why Tywin does n't think they should do anything about her , but Tywin reminds Joffrey that the last Targaryen dragons were stunted inbred creatures who were n't a threat to anyone , and Daenerys ' dragons are probably just curiosities at best , not grand weapons of war .
Tywin,Joffrey weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his mother , and Tywin also asks Pycelle to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep .
Tywin,Just as Amory Lorch reaches Tywin 's quarters , he falls down dead with a poisoned dart lodged in his neck .
Tywin,King Tommen recuses himself from the trial , appointing his grandfather Tywin , Prince Oberyn Martell , and Lord Mace Tyrell as judges .
Tywin,Later Tywin questions Arya about her origins .
Tywin,Later on , Robb and his lords are debating on the route of their march , and on whether to march directly against Tywin 's army or against Jaime 's army besieging Riverrun .
Tywin,Later on in his tent , Tyrion complains about his father to Shae , then decides to defy Tywin and take Shae to court anyway .
Tywin,Locke reasons that maiming Tywin 's son will be the ultimate proof that the Lannisters would never deal with Locke , much less bribe him .
Tywin,Lord Roose Bolton , who is also about to depart Harrenhal for the Twins , under orders from Robb Stark , requests that Jaime pass on his regards to Tywin ; Jaime asks that Bolton do the same for him with Robb .
Tywin,Lord Varys informs Tywin that the Hound has been spotted in the Riverlands , and Tywin orders a bounty on his head .
Tywin,Meanwhile , Tywin offers to work for the common good with a presumed enemy ; Sam takes stock of the personnel at Castle Black ; the Hound gives another life lesson to Arya ; and Daenerys makes a decision outside the walls of Meereen .
Tywin,Moreover , Tywin says that even if Daenerys ' dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago , they are on the far side of the world and no threat to Joffrey 's rule .
Tywin,Nor did Aerys listen to Varys when he gave the same warning that Tywin could n't be trusted - but he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle , who convinced Aerys the Lannisters were there to help .
Tywin,Petyr Baelish ambitiously pushes his way past everyone else to be the one who sits closest to Tywin .
Tywin,Petyr `` Littlefinger '' Baelish arrives at camp and meets with Tywin .
Tywin,Realizing her unchanged position on the matter , Tywin threatens to make Loras a knight of the Kingsguard , which would force Loras to give up his right to marriage and to inherit Highgarden .
Tywin,Realizing that she has missed her chance to kill Tywin , Arya pressures the assassin Jaqen H'ghar into aiding her escape from Harrenhal .
Tywin,Reluctantly impressed by Tyrion 's astute judgment of the situation , Tywin orders his son to go to King 's Landing and serve as Acting Hand of the King in Tywin 's stead .
Tywin,Returning his son 's hateful glare with one of his own , Tywin retorts that he remembers all too well .
Tywin,Returning to the trial , Tywin orders the next witness to testify : Shae .
Tywin,Robb and Brynden , however , are furious with Edmure : their grand strategy was to lure Tywin and Gregor's armies into the Westerlands , where they would be vulnerable , out of position , and unable to defend the capital against the Baratheons .
Tywin,Robb decides that with the main Lannister army-group under Tywin now positioned all the way to the east in King 's Landing , he needs to return to the Westerlands and make an all-or-nothing assault against Casterly Rock .
Tywin,She is upset for a moment , but then Doran explains his solution : his son Trystane will go along with them , to take over the seat on the Small Council which Tywin granted to Oberyn , but which was vacated by his death .
Tywin,She says Tywin should try stopping Joffrey from doing what he likes ( implying he will find it extremely difficult ) , but her father firmly responds , `` I will . ''
Tywin,She then reveals that she has spilled their secret to Tywin .
Tywin,Subsequently , Cersei meets with her father Tywin in his chambers .
Tywin,Taking King 's Landing would have been difficult to begin with , but now Tywin and the bulk of the main Lannister army , as well as a large Tyrell army , are defending the city .
Tywin,The Lannister army is now exposed , so Tywin decides to retreat to Harrenhal , the great castle on the northern shores of Gods Eye , and use it as a base of operations .
Tywin,The Tyrells ( Margaery , Olenna , Mace , and Loras ) , as well as Varys , Prince Oberyn , Tywin , Tyrion , and Sansa Stark , make little effort to hide their disgust .
Tywin,The entire Small Council tenses waiting for Tywin to respond to this shocking insult : instead Tywin coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the Queen Regent to see him to bed .
Tywin,The men they slaughtered were not Tywin 's main army but unwilling boy soldiers and conscripts from the Westerlands .
Tywin,The moment Tywin utters the word `` whore '' again , Tyrion looses his crossbow bolt , hitting Tywin in the belly and knocking him backwards .
Tywin,The short joyful moments for Tyrion and Jaime are shattered , as Tywin stands and proclaims the will of the gods is clear : Tyrion is guilty and sentenced to death .
Tywin,The topic changes to the murder of Oberyn 's sister Elia by Tywin 's `` pet , '' the Mountain , during the Sack of King 's Landing .
Tywin,The topic of just why Tyrion was even in Volantis comes up , and Tyrion is surprised that Jorah did not ask earlier : he explains that he actually fled from Westeros because he killed his own father Tywin .
Tywin,Theon Greyjoy murdered Robb 's younger brothers at Winterfell , which makes Sansa Robb 's heir : if he dies , rule of Winterfell and the North goes to her and any man she marries ... which Tywin has no intention of letting the Tyrells get their hands on .
Tywin,Therefore , even though Tywin admits the Lannisters can trust nobody except themselves , they need the Tyrells ' wealth and resources on their side .
Tywin,This enrages everyone in the court and Tywin orders Ser Meryn to escort Tyrion back to the dungeons .
Tywin,Though he does not know who she really is , Tywin realizes that she is of northern extraction and questions her about her origins and opinions regarding Robb .
Tywin,Tyrion , drunkenly proclaiming himself `` the god of tits and wine , '' reminds his father that Tywin has long called him `` a drunken little lust-filled beast , '' so doing his duty in the marriage bed will not pose a problem .
Tywin,Tyrion admits that he just murdered Shae with his bare hands , but Tywin scoffs that it does n't matter as she was nothing more than a whore .
Tywin,Tyrion demands to know when Tywin ever put the family 's interests above his own .
Tywin,Tyrion flatly refuses , but Tywin points out that recently he was complaining that he was n't rewarded for his actions in the Battle of the Blackwater , and as heiress to the North , Sansa is a far better reward than he could expect , and in any case , it is long past time Tyrion was we
Tywin,Tyrion heads to the Small Council chamber to report success to his father Tywin , only to find Cersei present as well , much to his annoyance .
Tywin,Tyrion is angered by Tywin 's indifference and raises the crossbow , threatening that if his father says the word `` whore '' one more time he will kill him .
Tywin,Tyrion is the only one who even mildly stands up to Tywin 's posturing , by not even trying to sit closest to Tywin : instead he takes a new chair and makes a point of noisily dragging it across the ground until it is positioned at the exact opposite end of the table from his father .
Tywin,Tyrion points out that if Baelish departs for the Vale that leaves a vacancy on the Small Council , and Tywin reveals that he has appointed Tyrion as the new Master of Coin to replace him .
Tywin,Tyrion previously noted that he is next in line of succession after Jaime , as a younger son inherits before an older daughter , but Tywin said he would never let his hated dwarf son be his heir .
Tywin,Tyrion questions if it is wise to offend their allies by refusing the match , but Tywin points out that as a plot against them , the Tyrells ' plan is , by definition , a secret , thus the Lannisters ca n't be said to be `` refusing '' them something which they are n't officially trying to do .
Tywin,Tyrion says he can not go back to Tywin 's chambers because Shae 's body is still there .
Tywin,Tyrion shows his distaste for Tywin 's choice of a wedding as the place to inflict the slaughter , but Tywin responds , asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in battle is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a wedding .
Tywin,Tyrion then says that Shae will not leave King 's Landing and is warned that Tywin has threatened to hang the next whore Tyrion is seen with .
Tywin,Tyrion tries to protest , pointing out that Joffrey has made Sansa 's life a living hell since the day he had her father executed and to force Tyrion on her after she has finally escaped Joffrey is cruel , even by Tywin 's standards .
Tywin,Tywin 's daughter Cersei arrives to find the seats are all occupied , but not wanting to play that game and be relegated to a lowly position , she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at Tywin 's right hand , opposite Littlefinger .
Tywin,Tywin accepts the aid of the hill tribesmen , but Shagga will only fight if Tyrion fights alongside them , a prospect which Tywin welcomes and terrifies Tyrion .
Tywin,Tywin is particularly insulted that Tyrion brought his mistress , Shae , to the capital when Tywin explicitly told him not to , which makes Tywin convince himself that Tyrion was in bed with Shae most of the time while events spiraled out of control .
Tywin,Tywin is still apparently confused , so with a merciless grin Cersei reveals that all of the rumors about her and Jaime ( and their children ) are true - she will tell everyone and destroy Tywin 's vaunted family legacy , even though it will also mean her death and Tommen 's death .
Tywin,Tywin observes that only the Dornish successfully resisted Aegon Targaryen 's dragons during his invasion of Westeros three centuries ago ; Oberyn dryly notes it must be hard for Tywin to admit he needs the Dornish for help .
Tywin,Tywin says that the laws of men say he has to let Tyrion use his family name , but that he wishes he could prove Tyrion was n't his son , so his very existence would not continue to make a mockery out of the name `` Lannister '' which he stole from Tywin .
Tywin,Varys also informs the council of Daenerys 's conquest of Meereen , and Tywin decides to take measures to prevent her from launching an invasion .
Tywin,Varys begins walking back towards the Red Keep but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll , signaling the discovery of Tywin 's body .
Tywin,When Cersei protests she is Queen Regent and not a brood mare , Tywin angrily roars back that she is his daughter and will do as she is told : she will marry Loras and in so doing , put an end to what Tywin calls `` the disgusting rumors '' Stannis has been spreading about her and Jaime .
Tywin,When Joffrey complains that he would have to climb too many steps should he wish to sit in on a small council meeting , Tywin silently ascends the steps to stand next to the throne , silently glares down at Joffrey , and then sardonically says he could arrange to have Joffrey carried .
Tywin,When Joffrey protests that he has n't been counseled on anything , Tywin says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform Joffrey should he deem it necessary .
Tywin,When Tyrion arrives with a letter from Lord Tywin , appointing him as acting Hand of the King in Tywin 's stead , Cersei becomes livid .
Tywin,When Tyrion asks why his father is doing this , Tywin is shocked as if Tyrion insulted him , and says it should be obvious as Tyrion `` killed '' his mother Joanna in childbirth so that he might enter the world .
Tywin,When Tyrion mentions what a horrible father Tywin was , Daenerys admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father .
Tywin,While Tywin is distracted , Arya sees that a letter on his table is about her older brother Robb Stark , so she snatches it .
Tywin,With Cersei out of the picture , both Margaery and Tywin will attempt to get their claws into Tommen , each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance .
Tywin,`` All my life you 've wanted me dead , '' Tyrion states , and Tywin acknowledges the validity of his claim .
Tywin,`` I am your son , '' Tyrion replies quietly , `` I have always been your son , '' and fires a second bolt into Tywin 's heart , killing him .
Tywin Lannister,At Harrenhal , Tywin Lannister is discussing the assassination of Amory Lorch with Ser Gregor Clegane .

Tywin Lannister,Bolton has been appointed as the new Warden of the North , replacing the Starks - though Tywin Lannister intends to eventually give the position to a future Lannister heir produced by Tyrion Lannister and Sansa Stark .
Tywin Lannister,Edmure tries to at least point out that they lost only two hundred men at Stone Mill and multiple Lannister soldiers died for every man they lost , at which Robb cuts him off and shouts that they need their men more than Tywin Lannister needs his ( who already outnumber the Starks significantly ) .
Tywin Lannister,Gendry loudly criticizes Arya , in disbelief that she used up two of the names on minor Lannister guards when she could have said someone like `` King Joffrey '' or `` Tywin Lannister '' and ended the entire war , at which Arya gets quite defensive .
Tywin Lannister,Gendry says he 's been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it : he worked most of his life for Tobho Mott and he repaid Gendry by selling him to the Night 's Watch ( as soon as the secret payments from Varys ended ) , and he `` served '' Tywin Lannister as a prisoner at Harrenhal , every day afraid he 'd be killed or tortured .
Tywin Lannister,Grand Maester Pycelle steps into the arena and begins making a long-winded speech asking the gods to favor the innocent before Tywin Lannister cuts him short and begins the trial by combat .
Tywin Lannister,He is informed by a gloating Grand Maester Pycelle that he is no longer Acting Hand of the King , as his father Tywin Lannister has returned to the city and will take over his duties as Hand .
Tywin Lannister,He refuses his mother 's suggestion that they ask Tywin Lannister for aid in the search for Arya because he does not feel it is necessary to find her and does not feel it is fitting for a king to ask for help .
Tywin Lannister,However , he can not lose , for the sake of Ned , Sansa , and Arya , as if he is defeated , Tywin Lannister will show their family no mercy .

Tywin Lannister,Meanwhile , Tywin Lannister enters the throne room to answer a summons from King Joffrey .
Tywin Lannister,Robb 's uncle Edmure Tully insists that if word of this leaves Riverrun , Tywin Lannister will exact heavy reprisals for the deaths of his young nephews .
Tywin Lannister,Robb rallies his father 's northern bannermen against Tywin Lannister and heads south to war .
Tywin Lannister,Robb says Tywin Lannister realizes that he 's in such a strong position he does n't even need to attack the Northerners anymore , he just needs to wait , and let their demoralized forces unravel .
Tywin Lannister,Roose notes that while he has been named Warden of the North , Tywin Lannister will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn , and he had intended on trading Theon for Moat Cailin , a strategically placed fortress on the border between the North and the Riverlands currently held by Greyjoy forces , preventing the main Bolton army from returning north .
Tywin Lannister,Ser Beric was commanded by none other than Eddard Stark to lead a group of soldiers to track down and bring to justice the false knight Ser Gregor Clegane , when he started raiding the Riverlands under Tywin Lannister 's orders at the very beginning of the War of the Five Kings .
Tywin Lannister,She points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused , he has n't hurt the ones who killed his father , Joffrey and Tywin Lannister .
Tywin Lannister,The forces of Tywin Lannister and , it is revealed , his new allies in House Tyrell join the battle .
Tywin Lannister,Though the man initially refuses , Jaime uses the promise of a reward and the threat of Tywin Lannister 's retribution to convince him to go back .
Tywin Lannister,Varys then says that there is nothing he can do to protect Shae any longer in fear of Tywin Lannister , the Hand of the King , or Cersei finding out that he has been lying to them .
Tywin Lannister,With Tywin Lannister's death , the pact between the Lannisters and the Boltons is effectively dead .
Tywin Lannister,With growing realization , she assesses that even the brilliant Tywin Lannister never noticed what was going on between his own children , when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years .
Umber,Jon Umber assumes that he will lead the vanguard , and is offended by the suggestion that he would be made to march behind a Glover , threatening to withdraw from the host .
Umber,Jon Umber becomes irritated and questions why the northerners should be told what to do by rulers in the south at all , reminding them that the North was once independent of the other Kingdoms before the Targaryens threatened them with their dragons .
Umber,Smalljon replies otherwise and Umber guards enter the room with two hooded figures .

Unsullied,As Ser Barristan Selmy watches the Unsullied taking the bodies of the crucified masters down outside Meereen , a small boy approaches him , giving him a scroll bearing the seal of the Hand .
Unsullied,Barristan explains that although there are only 2,000 of them , the Second Sons are armored and mounted , enough to cause trouble for the Unsullied .
Unsullied,Before the Unsullied can comply , Jorah declares that he brought her a gift , and Tyrion enters the arena and reveals his identity to the astonished Queen .
Unsullied,Daario ( dressed as an Unsullied ) holds a knife at Missandei 's throat .
Unsullied,Daario explains that he has been using the Second Sons as spies throughout Meereen , since they are far less conspicuous than Unsullied and can indulge in the same vices as their informants ; Daario indicates his men 's effectiveness by stabbing his dagger through a false wall , seriously injuring the man hiding behind it .
Unsullied,Daario firmly nixes both ideas : Grey Worm is needed to command the Unsullied in keeping the city under control , while Tyrion is the only one of them to have any actual political experience .
Unsullied,Daenerys 's Unsullied push the leaders slowly towards the two dragons , who can be heard growling from the darkness .
Unsullied,Daenerys insists that her Unsullied will restore order , but Fennesz points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety , he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew .
Unsullied,Daenerys is outraged by this , but still asks how many Unsullied are available .
Unsullied,Daenerys says she will take all 8,000 Unsullied soldiers , including those in training .
Unsullied,Daenerys speaks with Kraznys mo Nakloz , as he shows her his slave soldiers , the Unsullied .

Unsullied,Dany commands him and several Unsullied to infiltrate Meereen disguised as slaves and convince the slaves to rise against their masters .
Unsullied,Disgusted , Daenerys issues the command that all Unsullied must choose their own new names as free men , or reclaim the names their parents gave them .
Unsullied,En route back to their ship , Ser Jorah urges that Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied , arguing that under her command , these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under Kraznys and his ilk .
Unsullied,Finding the exits blocked , the group makes a stand in the center of the Pit with remainder of the Unsullied defenders .
Unsullied,For a moment the Unsullied stare blankly : they have never known what freedom is .
Unsullied,Grey Worm counters that , had the masters not cut him , he never would have been Unsullied , he never would have been freed , chosen to lead them , and met her .
Unsullied,Grey Worm is among the ambushed Unsullied ; he kills many attackers , though he loses his helmet , is slashed in the leg , and is stabbed in his side .
Unsullied,He also wryly notes that any young boys she sells as slaves will be castrated and ready to serve as new Unsullied when their training is over in about ten years ' time .
Unsullied,However Daenerys is not threatened , commenting that a hard-fought battle would give her Unsullied much needed practice .

Unsullied,In the Great Pyramid , Varys holds court when the Unsullied bring in Vala , a prostitute who is in league with the Sons of the Harpy .
Unsullied,Jorah and Barristan continue to disagree on whether or not Daenerys should purchase the Unsullied .
Unsullied,Jorah claims that not only will the slave soldiers be treated better in her service , but innocent people will also be spared in war because the Unsullied only do as they are ordered .
Unsullied,Kraznys also demonstrates that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier ( much to Daenerys 's disgust ) , who not only shows no sign of pain , but thanks the slavemaster for the opportunity to serve him .
Unsullied,Kraznys goes on to explain that the Unsullied are trained to show no mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training .
Unsullied,Kraznys laughs and retorts that she can barely afford 100 Unsullied .
Unsullied,Kraznys tells Daenerys , via Missandei 's interpretation in the Low Valyrian language , that many of the Unsullied have not yet seen battle , so she would do well to attack some minor cities and towns here and there on her way to Westeros .
Unsullied,Meanwhile , Daenerys and her translator/aide-de-camp Missandei meet with the assembled officers of the Unsullied .
Unsullied,Most of the Sons of the Harpy are dead but they outnumber the Unsullied so much to begin with that only Grey Worm is left .
Unsullied,Of course , Missandei is not Dothraki , but she says it does n't matter , as Grey Worm is n't interested in her - none of the Unsullied desire women .
Unsullied,One of the Unsullied , White Rat , is seen walking into a brothel and pays a prostitute to lie with him and comfort him .
Unsullied,Ser Jorah Mormont notes that the elite warrior-eunuchs produced in Astapor , known as the Unsullied , are said to be among the finest soldiers in the world .
Unsullied,She addresses them in Low Valyrian , and says that now that they are no longer slaves but free men and they can make their own choices , and she asked them to choose one among them to be leader of all the Unsullied .
Unsullied,She asks the Unsullied to stay and fight for her , not as slaves but as free men .
Unsullied,She had seduced and murdered several members of the Second Sons and Unsullied .
Unsullied,She hands the leash to Kraznys , and in return he gives her a cat-o-nine-tails with a hilt shaped like a Harpy , signifying ownership of the Unsullied .
Unsullied,She is irritated to learn that Daario Naharis has captured Meereen 's navy without her explicit orders to do so , but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for Westeros and taking King 's Landing with her 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons .
Unsullied,She rides out with her eight thousand strong army of Unsullied marching in formation , as her three dragons fly above them .
Unsullied,Telling her dragons to fly , Daenerys steps out of the protection of the Unsullied and into the crowd , who carry on their chanting .
Unsullied,The Unsullied commander says that he will continue to be known as `` Grey Worm '' : his original name is accursed , because it was the name he had when he was taken as a slave , but `` Grey Worm '' is a lucky name he will bear with pride , because it is the name he had when he was set free by Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen .
Unsullied,The Unsullied give chase , only to be surrounded by a much larger number of the Sons of the Harpy .
Unsullied,The Unsullied obey her commands without question , and instantly begin attacking all of the assembled slave-masters .
Unsullied,The Unsullied proceed to sack the entire city , slaughtering the slave masters and freeing fellow slaves , supported by the fire of Daenerys ' dragons .
Unsullied,The Unsullied remove the large gold harpy from the top of the Great Pyramid in Meereen to show the Meereenese people they are under Targaryen rule now and their old traditions are gone .
Unsullied,The Unsullied trample the whip under their feet as they march past .
Unsullied,The Yunkish herald is carried into Daenerys 's camp on a litter carried by slaves , along a road flanked by Unsullied .
Unsullied,Then one starts tapping the end of his spear against the ground in support , and the others join in , until thousands of Unsullied are triumphantly striking their spears against the ground in praise of Daenerys .
Unsullied,They explain that the Unsullied are trained for battle from the age of five , and that only one in four recruits survives the training .
Unsullied,They strike a deal that she may have all the Unsullied soldiers in exchange for her biggest dragon .
Unsullied,This is to enforce the mentality in the Unsullied that this is just what they are : worthless , expendable vermin .
Unsullied,To the surprise of Missandei , Daenerys calls the Unsullied to attention in Valyrian , and proceeds to test them with basic Valyrian marching commands .
Unsullied,Upon arriving at Astapor , Daenerys is given a tour of the Unsullied barracks by the Unsullied 's owner , Kraznys mo Nakloz , with his slave girl Missandei translating his Low Valyrian into the Common Tongue of Westeros for Daenerys .
Unsullied,Vala is defiant and states that she opposes the new regime imposed by the Unsullied and Second Sons as illegitimate .
Unsullied,When the slaves advance on Daenerys , the Unsullied step into formation , but the queen tells them to stand down .
Vaes Dothrak,Catelyn renews an old friendship with a member of the court , while Daenerys and Viserys journey onwards to the Dothraki capital of Vaes Dothrak .

Vale,Baelish proposes that the soldiers of the Vale could fight instead but Cersei is unsure of Baelish 's ability to lead an army .
Vale,Cersei then explains why she summoned Baelish ; she is suspicious where his loyalties truly lie and asks him whether she can rely on the the Vale to fight for the Throne if the time comes .
Vale,Despite setting in motion this chain of events with her letter to her sister regarding the murder of Jon Arryn , Lysa does not believe that war is in the Vale 's best interests and rather want the knights to stay in the Vale to protect her son and their Lord .

Vale of Arryn,Tywin states that this will confirm that the Vale of Arryn , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support Robb Stark , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies ( other marriage alliances , with House Tyrell of the Reach and House Martell of Dorne , combined with the crushing of the Baratheons , have in turn secured the rest of southern Westeros under Lannister control ) .
Valyria,As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon , Tyrion deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of Old Valyria , a shorter route to Meereen and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria 's reputation .
Valyria,Everyone claimed Shireen would die of it sooner or later , and urged Stannis to send her to the ruins of Valyria to live out her days with the `` Stone Men '' before the disease infected the rest of the castle ; Stannis says he told them all to go to hell and summoned every healer , apothecary and Maester he could to save Shireen .

Valyrian,When a dumbfounded Kraznys demands an explanation , she declares that she is Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen , of the blood of Old Valyria : Valyrian is her mother-tongue indicating she 'd been feigning ignorance the entire time ( and putting up with Kraznys ' insulting comments ) to lull them into a false sense of security .
Vardis,Bronn agrees , but indicates that Vardis did fight with honor .
Vardis,Bronn fights defensively , waiting for Vardis to tire , as unlike Bronn he is dressed in full armor .

Varys,Cersei and the remainder of the small council , comprised of Grand Maester Pycelle , Varys , and Littlefinger , summon Sansa to inform her that her father has been arrested for treason .
Varys,Eddard grimly responds `` It 's a shame no one prayed for the butcher 's boy '' , which visibly upsets Varys .

Varys,Further south , Tyrion Lannister and Varys depart Pentos in a large wheelhouse pulled by many horses .
Varys,Gendry says he 's been serving other men his whole life and he has nothing to show for it : he worked most of his life for Tobho Mott and he repaid Gendry by selling him to the Night 's Watch ( as soon as the secret payments from Varys ended ) , and he `` served '' Tywin Lannister as a prisoner at Harrenhal , every day afraid he 'd be killed or tortured .
Varys,He also warns Pod to be aware of his surroundings and watch out for `` They , '' `` They '' being the spies of Tywin , Cersei , Varys or more or less anyone else .

Varys,It becomes apparent that Jorah is trying to figure out if Barristan knew that Jorah was initially a spy for King Robert , reporting back to Varys .
Varys,Jaime curtly says that Varys did ( when in fact , Jaime forced Varys to help him free Tyrion ) .
Varys,Jorah is delivered a message from Varys , a royal pardon for his crimes ; he quickly realizes that this news would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy .
Varys,Leaving the chamber , Eddard talks to Varys , who slyly points out that Lancel Lannister ensured the King kept `` refreshed '' with alcohol during the hunt , meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable .
Varys,Lord Varys informs Tywin that the Hound has been spotted in the Riverlands , and Tywin orders a bounty on his head .
Varys,Meanwhile , further south in the Free Cities , Tyrion Lannister and Varys finally arrive at Volantis .
Varys,Ordered to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world , he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from Varys .
Varys,Qyburn is in the company of the little birds , children who used to spy for Varys .

Varys,Several witnesses are called for the prosecution , including Ser Meryn Trant , Grand Maester Pycelle , Queen Regent Cersei , and Varys , all of whom give testimony backing the accusations against Tyrion .
Varys,She hears two men - Varys and Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos - talking .
Varys,She points out that there will be two feather beds , and Varys realizes Littlefinger would only pay the extra money for someone other than Littlefinger if it was Sansa .
Varys,She then unnerves Varys by revealing that she knows Varys was emasculated by a `` second-rate sorcerer '' and offers to repeat the words he heard in the flames , and identify who it was that spoke .
Varys,The Night 's Watch takes stock ; Varys meets his better ; Arya is taken to the commander of the Brotherhood ; Daenerys makes an exchange .
Varys,The Tyrells ( Margaery , Olenna , Mace , and Loras ) , as well as Varys , Prince Oberyn , Tywin , Tyrion , and Sansa Stark , make little effort to hide their disgust .
Varys,The dragons retreat , and Tyrion hastily returns to Varys .
Varys,The other members of the council - Pycelle , Renly , Littlefinger and Varys - all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm .
Varys,The pair move through the Long Bridge 's markets , where Varys explains the meaning of the various tattoos Volantene slaves must sport .
Varys,The sorcerer needed his genitals as a sacrifice for a spell , and he burned Varys ' genitals in a brazier of fire .
Varys,They discuss the role of Varys in their stories and Tyrion assures Daenerys he trusts him , and that he 's probably the reason she was n't killed years ago .
Varys,They walk through the gardens , and while Olenna remains relatively polite she instantly sees through all of Varys ' pleasantries .
Varys,This is why Varys has always hated those who claim to wield magical powers , and particularly why he opposed Stannis Baratheon , who relies on the Red Priestess Melisandre .
Varys,To Tyrion 's astonishment , it contains an elderly sorcerer , the very same one that castrated Varys so many years ago .

Varys,Tyrion finds Varys on his way to a breakfast celebration on the day of Joffrey 's wedding .
Varys,Tyrion has descended into bitterness and self-loathing , seemingly determined to drink himself to death , but Varys angrily snaps him out of his self pity , telling Tyrion that he still has talents that may yet be of use ; talents that he could use to seat the right candidate on the Iron Throne .
Varys,Tyrion instructs Varys to punch him if he ever suggests doing anything like that again .
Varys,Tyrion next leads Varys to a brothel .
Varys,Tyrion recalls from Small Council meetings that Jorah was spying on Daenerys for Varys .
Varys,Tyrion warns Varys not to underestimate him .

Varys,Tywin also tells him to deal with Baelish , Varys , and Pycelle if he gets so much as a hint of treachery from any of them .
Varys,Tywin asks what news there is of the war , and Varys reports that Robb has taken the bulk of his army to Riverrun for his grandfather 's funeral , while leaving Lord Roose Bolton in command of Harrenhal .
Varys,Using his own life as an example , Varys thus urges Tyrion to be patient , and his revenge will come to him in time .
Varys,Using this information , Tyrion asks Varys to use his little birds to send them a message .
Varys,Varys uses this opportunity to finish a conversation they were having on the eve of the battle , in which Varys promised to reveal how he was castrated .
Varys,What Varys has had recurrent nightmares about to this day is not the sorcerer , or the knife , or the pain ... but that when the sorcerer prayed to the blue flames in his ceremony , a voice clearly answered him from the flames .
Varys,When Eddard suggests they should just kill him , Varys says `` Not today , my lord . ''
Varys,When Tyrion asks if he saw it sail away , Bronn assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her , that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and Varys .
Varys,When Tyrion retorts that such a man does not exist , Varys points out that he never said this ruler would be a man .
Varys,Whether it was a god or a demon or simply parlor tricks , Varys never knew , as the sorcerer threw him out into the street to die .
Varys,While the rulers of Meereen enjoy a tenuous peace , Tyrion reminds them of the need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys 's blessing , as the Masters could use Tyrion and Varys 's foreign status against them to reclaim Slaver 's Bay .
Vhagar,They share a laugh about how a knight tried to kill the dragon Vhagar by sneaking up on it with a mirrored shield , but it did n't fool the dragon , who promptly roasted the knight .

Viserion,Later , she leads her remaining two dragons , Rhaegal and Viserion , into the catacombs , where they are distracted by sheep carcasses .
Viserion,Missandei and Grey Worm tell Tyrion that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating ever since Daenerys left .
Viserion,The leaders are brought to the catacombs where Rhaegal and Viserion are chained up .
Viserys,After the rest leave , Ser Barristan tells her about her father , and confirms that , contrary to what Viserys told her , the Mad King was indeed quite mad , citing how his crimes against House Stark ultimately led to the rebellion that all but destroyed the Targaryen dynasty .
Viserys,As Daenerys watches her brother die , she coldly states that , having been killed by fire , Viserys was no true dragon .

Viserys,Daenerys arrives at Vaes Dothrak and finally stands up to Viserys .
Viserys,Daenerys calms the situation and Viserys is forced to walk , a sign of shame amongst the horse-riding Dothraki .
Viserys,Daenerys is surprised , because her brother Viserys only told her that Rhaegar was a great killer .
Viserys,Daenerys was born months after Robert Baratheon killed Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident , and only knew her cruel and half-mad brother Viserys , so she asks Ser Barristan if he knew Rhaegar .
Viserys,Drogo melts his golden belt in a pot , while Viserys begs Daenerys to help him .
Viserys,Drogo responds that he will give Viserys a golden crown `` that men will tremble to behold '' , and Viserys is pleased until Drogo 's bloodrider Qotho breaks his arm , making him drop the sword , and kicks him to the floor .
Viserys,Drunk , bitter and angry , Viserys interrupts a feast for Daenerys and Drogo .
Viserys,He wants Daenerys , the unborn child , and Viserys dead as soon as possible .

Viserys,In Vaes Dothrak , Viserys ' frustrations at the constant delays before he can receive his crown boil over .
Viserys,In his anger , Viserys tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her , calling her nothing but a `` horselord 's slut '' , and warning her that she 's `` awoken the Dragon '' , but this time she fights back , hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt .
Viserys,In return , Drogo will give Viserys the army he needs to reclaim the Iron Throne .
Viserys,In the Free City of Pentos , across the Narrow Sea , Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen enjoy the hospitality of Magister Illyrio Mopatis .

Viserys,Jorah Mormont prevents Viserys from stealing Dany 's eggs .
Viserys,Khal Drogo gives Viserys a golden crown .
Viserys,Later , Daenerys confides in Mormont her realization that Viserys will never become King of Westeros .
Viserys,Robert agrees , but if they land and the knights of Westeros take shelter behind their castle walls , the Dothraki could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept Viserys as their king regardless .
Viserys,Ser Jorah swears fealty to Viserys as King and offers him his support and advice , which is accepted .
Viserys,She tells a thunderstruck Viserys that she is the Khal 's wife , and is carrying his child ( and by implication , Viserys is nothing to the Dothraki ) , and warns that if he raises a hand against her again , he will lose his hands .
Viserys,She watches as Khal Drogo `` crowns '' Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head , causing Viserys to cry out in pure agony .

Volantis,Teasing Tyrion about abandoning him in Volantis , he is pleased to see Tyrion already settling into a role that suits him .
Volantis,The lead slaver , Malko , intends to return them back to their destination in Volantis .
Volantis,The topic of just why Tyrion was even in Volantis comes up , and Tyrion is surprised that Jorah did not ask earlier : he explains that he actually fled from Westeros because he killed his own father Tywin .
Volantis,Tyrion Lannister along with Grey Worm , Missandei , and Varys meet with representatives of the Good Masters of Astapor , the Wise Masters of Yunkai , and the slave-trading city of Volantis ; who have arrived by sea .

Volantis,Varys explains that they are travelling to Meereen by way of Volantis .

Waif,During her training , Arya continues sparring with the Waif while answering questions about her family and the Hound .
Waif,He does , however , point out that Arya can not be no one , as she is wearing Arya Stark 's clothes , is in possession of silver stolen by Arya Stark , and was about to attack the Waif using Arya Stark 's sword .
Waif,However , Arya is able to deflect her blow and leap out of the way , surprising the Waif .
Waif,However , Jaqen H'ghar and the Waif appear and say that Meryn 's life was not hers to take , and that a debt must be paid .
Waif,Jaqen , in the Waif 's body , says that he is no one .

Waif,The Waif then asks Arya whether she believed the story , surprising Arya .
Waif,The Waif then interrogates Arya about the people on her list : Cersei , Gregor Clegane and Walder Frey .
Waif,The Waif voices her disbelief that Arya 's list is so short , but Arya counters by asking which name she wants added .
Waif,When Arya does n't respond , embarrassed that she bought the Waif 's story , the Waif tells her to get back to work , hinting to Arya that to pass the game of faces , Arya must be able to lie convincingly .
Waif,When Arya insists that she is no one , the Waif does not believe her and tries to hit her .

Walder,Bolton expresses his concern that Brynden Tully escaped the massacre , but Walder dismisses his worries , pointing out that the Blackfish - and the remaining Tully garrison at Riverrun - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the Lannisters , Boltons , and Freys , although Bolton is still visibly concerned .
Walder,Catelyn holds a knife to the girl 's throat and threatens to kill her if Walder does not negotiate an end to the attack .

Walder Frey,Catelyn kills Walder Frey 's wife , the Lady Joyeuse , moments before being killed herself .
Walder Frey,He confronts Tywin about his part in the Red Wedding , and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it , as Walder Frey is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own .
Walder Frey,Robb presents himself to Walder Frey , and Edmure meets his bride .
Walder Frey,The Freys carry Walder Frey 's demands for an alliance , which includes a formal apology from Robb , the castle Harrenhal and all of its lands and incomes , and for Edmure Tully to marry Roslin , one of his daughters .
Walder Frey,The Waif then interrogates Arya about the people on her list : Cersei , Gregor Clegane and Walder Frey .
Walk of Punishment,In Astapor , Daenerys , accompanied by Ser Jorah Mormont and Ser Barristan Selmy , walks along a sea wall known as the `` Walk of Punishment . ''

Wall,After a fierce duel , Jon mortally wounds Qhorin per Qhorin 's own instructions , who whispers to Jon `` We are the watchers on the Wall '' before he breathes his last , signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding Jon that he must find out all he can about the wildlings ' plans and get back to the Wall .
Wall,After surviving the perilous climb of the Wall , Jon Snow , Ygritte , and the wildlings led by Tormund Giantsbane make their way towards Castle Black to await Mance Rayder's signal to begin the attack on the Night 's Watch .
Wall,Afterwards , Jon tries to convince the Night 's Watch to barricade the Wall against the imminent wildling invasion by blocking off Castle Black 's entry tunnel with ice and rock .
Wall,Alliser Thorne arrives with reinforcements from the top of the Wall via the wooden lift system , which is being operated by Olly .
Wall,Alliser orders the archers on the Wall to nock their arrows , but they draw instead while Grenn accidentally drops a barrel down the Wall .

Wall,At the Wall , and Beyond
Wall,At the Wall , the mutineers have left Jon 's body where he fell .
Wall,At the Wall and the North
Wall,Atop the Wall , Eddison Tollett , who Jon left in command of the defenses , orders the men to drop the 'scythe . '
Wall,Before departing for King 's Landing , Tyrion fulfils an old ambition by climbing to the top of the Wall and urinating off the edge of it .
Wall,Benjen Stark meets Jon atop the Wall and tells him he is going on a ranging in the Haunted Forest .
Wall,Benjen also scolds Tyrion for his naivety regarding what is north of the Wall and states that Tyrion has no authority to say what is or is n't beyond the Wall as he has n't been out there himself .
Wall,Benjen talks with Jon on the Wall .
Wall,Benjen welcomes them , and Tyrion seems impressed by the Wall 's sheer size .
Wall,Beyond the Wall
Wall,Beyond the Wall , rangers , led by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont , seek help from a dangerous wildling .
Wall,Both of them are shocked to see a speechless and despondent Melisandre return to the Wall .
Wall,Bran , Rickon , Osha , Hodor , and the direwolves Summer and Shaggydog continue to head north from Winterfell to the Wall .
Wall,Bran asks Sam to take him and his group north of the Wall , and though Sam protests the idea , given the threat of the White Walkers and the undead horde they command approaching , he eventually relents and takes them through the passage .
Wall,Bran explains , to Osha 's discomfort , that wildling attacks coming over or around the Wall caused most of the smallfolk to flee the Gift over the centuries .
Wall,Circumstances change after an unexpected arrival from north of the Wall .
Wall,Gilly is amazed that Sam knows so much history just from reading books , insisting that he is a wizard ( much to Sam 's delight ) and is awestruck when she finally catches a glimpse of the Wall .
Wall,Gilly wants Sam to stay with her as he promised , but he can not as he swore to defend the Wall as a brother of the Night 's Watch .
Wall,He agrees to return to the Wall with them .
Wall,He also wants to take Selyse and Shireen with them , as he does not think they will be safe at the Wall , surrounded by criminals .
Wall,He explains that he is eager to bring Dorne back into the fold , wanting to unite the Seven Kingdoms against more obvious threats ; the Greyjoys are in rebellion , a Wildling army is advancing on the Wall , and there is a Targaryen girl in the East with a powerful army and three dragons , who will eventually threaten Westeros .
Wall,He guesses correctly that Bronn has been beyond the Wall and killed someone before he was twelve years old ( though it was a woman , not a man , and he killed her in self-defense , because she was coming at him with an axe ) .
Wall,He hopes the Wall is big enough to hold them back when the Walkers come in force .
Wall,He hopes the White Walkers ca n't climb the Wall as there is not enough Dragonglass or Valyrian steel in Westeros to combat them .
Wall,He insists that the boys must go north to the Wall , as there are too many enemies in the south and Jon will be able to keep them safe and tell their mother of their survival .
Wall,He says the meat tastes so much better south of the Wall , and chides Tormund for losing their warg as well as Jon .
Wall,He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the Wall that ended in cannibalism .
Wall,His information and shelter in the harsh conditions north of the Wall have helped them many times before .
Wall,His uncle Benjen Stark , First Ranger of the Night 's Watch , arrives to join the feast , and Jon asks him to take him back to the Wall with him .
Wall,However , Mance calls Jon 's bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending Castle Black , he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the Wall , and they will attack Castle Black 's weak southern side as soon as he gives the order .
Wall,However , Mormont considers Craster too valuable a contact to risk offending , as he is one of their few sources of information and shelter beyond the Wall .
Wall,However , he managed to unite them all by telling them the truth : that they will all die if they remain north of the Wall .
Wall,In The North , on their way to the Wall , Bran Stark 's party makes camp .
Wall,In a moment of clarity , Aemon gravely warns Gilly that she and her son must leave the Wall while they still can , before winter comes ( and the White Walkers with it ) .

Wall,Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly are standing watch atop the Wall when Benjen 's horse is spotted returning , but , to Jon 's horror , there is no sign of Benjen himself .
Wall,Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister depart Winterfell for the Wall , and along the way Jon discovers his ideas of the Night 's Watch may not match the reality .
Wall,Jon Snow emerges from the outer gate of the Wall and begins trudging north through the aftermath of the previous night 's battle towards Mance Rayder's war camp .
Wall,Jon Snow is with the group of twenty wildlings under the command of Tormund , who were sent ahead of the main army of King-Beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder to scale the Wall and attack Castle Black from behind .
Wall,Jon Snow prepares to depart for the Wall .
Wall,Jon and Sam are sent to serve as sentries on top of the Wall until Mance arrives .

Wall,Jon looking off the top of the Wall .
Wall,Jon offers to take the watch up alone so Sam can go below , and as Sam steps into the elevator and begins to descend the Wall , an owl lands on top of the wall and begins hooting loudly .
Wall,Jon returns to the Wall .
Wall,Jon snaps back , acknowledging that he talks like a wildling and also admits to living amongst the wildlings , eating with them , and climbing the Wall with them .
Wall,Jon then jumps to mount a nearby horse and escapes , leaving Ygritte and heading back to the Wall .
Wall,Jon then takes Ygritte 's corpse to the north side of the Wall and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred Heart tree .
Wall,Jorah asks how he could have known his father Jeor Mormont , but Tyrion explains he visited the Wall once and met him : he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men , a rare thing in the world , but now as the eulogy for Night 's Watch members goes , `` the world will not see his like again . ''
Wall,Jorah asks how he died : Tyrion says he only knows the report he heard , which said that his father led an expedition beyond the Wall , but there was a mutiny , and Jeor was murdered by his own men .
Wall,Karl shouts that there are no laws beyond the Wall .
Wall,Later , Tyrion discusses north of the Wall with Jeor Mormont and his chief adviser , the ancient and blind Maester Aemon .
Wall,Lord Commander Jeor Mormont decides to overlook Jon 's brief desertion , saying many have fled the Wall , only to think better of it and return .
Wall,Lord Commander Jeor Mormont of the Night 's Watch leads the few survivors of the slaughter at the Battle of the Fist of the First Men south in hope of reaching the Wall .
Wall,Maester Luwin dismisses Theon and questions Osha about why her band crossed the Wall and were fleeing `` as far south as south goes '' .
Wall,Mance 's guards safely grab Jon during the distraction , and Mance demands to know if the Night 's Watch is attacking them , but Jon admits that it 's just as Mance said : the Night 's Watch does n't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the Wall and attack .
Wall,Mance orders Tormund to take Jon with him , as Jon knows the layout of Castle Black , and it will prove a key test of his loyalty : if it turns out that he wo n't really betray the Night 's Watch , Tormund can easily throw him off the Wall to his death .
Wall,Mance says that with Mormont , it 's possible he was able to escape , but that even if he did he and his men took quite a beating and are trapped miles away from the Wall with the White Walkers in close pursuit .
Wall,Mance then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the lands south of the Wall ; that the wildlings are moving south to seek refuge from the growing threat of the White Walkers just as those south of the Wall are .
Wall,Mance then makes his counteroffer : if the Night 's Watch will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the Wall , no more harm will come to the black brothers .
Wall,Meanwhile , Bran Stark and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the Seven Kingdoms proper , and entered into the Gift : a stretch of land south of the Wall which was gifted to the Night 's Watch thousands of years ago by Brandon the Builder , from which the Watch draws support for its material needs .
Wall,Meanwhile , a secret garrison of wildlings including Tormund , Styr , and Ygritte are poised to launch a surprise attack from the south of the Wall .
Wall,Mormont announces that they must retreat back to the Wall , not simply to save their own lives but because Castle Black and the rest of Westeros must be warned of the coming threat - otherwise everyone they 've ever known will die .
Wall,Mormont did n't know the man well , but he rode bravely into the unknown lands far beyond the Wall , fought valiantly at the Fist against monsters which they did n't even know existed , and they will never see a man that brave again .
Wall,Mormont orders Rast to keep Sam alive until they reach the Wall on pain of death .
Wall,Mormont tensely questions Craster 's claim to be a godly man , but Craster insists that he is - to the `` real gods , '' the White Walkers , who consume entire armies on their way to the Wall but will spare Craster for his loyalty .
Wall,Much to Thorne and Slynt 's surprise , Grenn , Eddison Tollett and a group of other men join Jon on his mission , including Locke who asks to say his vows if that is required before he goes north of the Wall .
Wall,North of the Wall , Samwell Tarly and Gilly continue their march south , after barely escaping an encounter with a White Walker during which Sam actually managed to kill the creature using a dragonglass dagger .
Wall,North of the Wall , the massive wildling army emerges from the woods , their numbers including giants riding atop mammoths .
Wall,Nothing about being sent to the Wall is fair .
Wall,On the northern side of the Wall , a wildling strike force led by two giants ( one of which is riding a mammoth ) charge towards Castle Black 's outer gate .
Wall,On the ride to the top of the Wall , Jon is discomfited by Melisandre 's presence and questions .
Wall,On top of the Wall , Janos Slynt , having no true leadership experience , breaks down at the sight of the massive wildling army and begins fumbling his orders .
Wall,On top of the Wall , Jon hears the horn blowing and looks north , witnessing a tremendous conflagration to the North , just as Mance had promised .
Wall,One giant , armed with a massive bow , manages to fire a huge arrow at one of the bunkers atop the Wall , completely obliterating it and killing the black brother manning it -- the force of the giant 's arrow carries the black brother off the wall on to the other side where he is shoved into ground with a tremendous amount of force .
Wall,Orell has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the Wall and he wants to know how frequent they are .
Wall,Orell says the wildlings know there are nineteen castles along the south side of the Wall , but he wants to know how many are currently manned .
Wall,Osha remains distrustful of Meera and Jojen Reed and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go beyond the Wall .
Wall,Pypar and Edd try to comfort Sam by saying she might be alive and hiding , as she has survived worse situations , such as living with Craster , making a long march to the Wall , and even surviving a White Walker .
Wall,Realizing the dire need for experienced men to defend the keep from the surprise attack , Alliser orders Janos Slynt to assume command of the Wall 's defenses and heads below to join the melee .
Wall,Sam arrives atop the Wall to ask Jon for more men to defend the castle , and Jon tasks Sam with releasing Ghost from his pen to assist in the fighting .
Wall,Sam defends himself by reciting the Night 's Watch oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the Wall they are on and repeating Jeor Mormont 's assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians .
Wall,Sam explains that he plans to get them across the Wall using a secret sally-port which leads right into the Nightfort .
Wall,Sam joins Jon on the Wall for sentry duty , even though he says his eyesight is weak , he is afraid of heights , and ca n't take the cold .
Wall,She angrily talks about how the people south of the Wall shut the the wildlings out by building it and hunting the wildlings as enemies ; she says that now the wildlings are the hunters and the southerners their prey .
Wall,She rages that none of them understand what lies beyond the Wall and that there is nothing left for men there .
Wall,She states that the animosity of the southerners to the Wildlings is arbitrary , given that the Wildlings are only distinguished from them by living north of the Wall when it was constructed .
Wall,She tells the other wildlings that most of the guards are at the top of the Wall and that few are left in the Castle .
Wall,She then walks through the gates of the Wall surrounded by more snow , and into Drogo 's tent .
Wall,Some time later , Will has fled south of the Wall in terror , rather than return to warn Castle Black of the White Walker threat .
Wall,South of the Wall , the Thenn warg 's owl also spots the fire and informs Styr and Tormund that the time has come to attack Castle Black .
Wall,Speaking to Craster 's wives , Jon warns them that Mance Rayder 's army and worse besides will soon reach their location and offers to take them to safety south of the Wall , but the women refuse , preferring to set out on their own .
Wall,Stannis confirms that his army will leave soon enough to confront the Boltons at Winterfell before the winter snows trap them at the Wall .
Wall,That night Bran asks Osha to take Rickon ( who would be heir to Winterfell if anything were to happen to Bran or Robb ) to Last Hearth , the home of House Umber , while he , Meera and Jojen head through the Wall in search of the Three-eyed raven .
Wall,The Lord Commander states that they do not have the manpower to afford venturing away from the Wall .
Wall,The Wall , as seen by Jon 's party .
Wall,The black brothers continue to rain down arrows on the advancing wildlings , even killing ones that are attempting to scale the Wall .
Wall,The black brothers defending the Wall manage to repel most of the wildlings attacking the outer gate , but one giant manages to make it through , greatly weakening the gate by repeatedly smashing it with his fists and managing to singlehandedly begin lifting the gate .
Wall,The desperate Night 's Watch recruits like Rast , mostly conscripted criminals exiled to the Wall , turn on officers who are loyal to Mormont , as well as some of the other common recruits like Grenn who stay loyal .
Wall,The fortresses of the Night 's Watch were purposefully built to only defend from attack over the Wall , without defenses on their southern sides , so they would n't be a threat to the lords of the Seven Kingdoms .
Wall,The groups then head in different directions ; Sam and Gilly for Castle Black , and the Reeds , Hodor , and Bran beyond the Wall .
Wall,The parties depart Winterfell : Jon , Tyrion and Benjen Stark to the Wall ; and Eddard , Arya , Sansa and the royal party south to King 's Landing .
Wall,The true war lies in the North , and evil and death are marching on the Wall .
Wall,The wildlings are caught in their own camp , resting from the battle the night before and only expecting attacks from the Wall , so their eastern flank is completely undefended .
Wall,Theon Greyjoy summons Hodor , the castle 's dim-witted stableboy , who can only say the word `` Hodor '' , to help carry Bran down to the great hall , where Robb Stark is hosting a meeting with Tyrion Lannister and Yoren , both traveling down from the Wall to King 's Landing together .
Wall,These wights appear far older than those seen near the Wall , appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility .
Wall,Thousands of wildlings come through the Wall to Castle Black itself , including many women and children , and even the giant Wun Wun .
Wall,Three rangers of the Night 's Watch : Ser Waymar Royce , Will , and Gared depart from the Wall to investigate reports of wildlings in the Haunted Forest which lies to the north , Beyond the Wall .
Wall,Tyrion tells Jon that the Night 's Watch is not a noble institution of glorious knights defending the realm against the horrors lurking beyond the Wall , but a dumping ground for the unwanted and for criminals .
Wall,Tyrion then breakfasts with his other family members , informing them of his decision to journey north to see the Wall before returning to King 's Landing .
Wall,While approximately five thousand Free Folk gather to set sail to the Wall , the Night 's Watch starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent .
Wall,While climbing , Ygritte strikes the Wall and causes a massive crack , which dislodges a large sheet of ice , sending several wildlings to their deaths .
Wall,While in the mill , Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall , before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby .

Watch,Meanwhile , Bran Stark and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the Seven Kingdoms proper , and entered into the Gift : a stretch of land south of the Wall which was gifted to the Night 's Watch thousands of years ago by Brandon the Builder , from which the Watch draws support for its material needs .
Watch,Meanwhile , the Watch 's diminishing numbers mean they do n't really need that much support from the Gift anymore , explaining why they have n't encountered any brothers of the Watch working the lands either .

Westerlands,Lord Tywin Lannister is torn between needing to defend King 's Landing and wanting to drive King Robb Stark from the Westerlands .

Westerlands,The men they slaughtered were not Tywin 's main army but unwilling boy soldiers and conscripts from the Westerlands .
Westerlands,Tywin reveals to Cersei their problem with the Iron Bank of Braavos ; they owe 'a tremendous sum , ' and the gold mines of the Westerlands actually ran dry three years ago .
Westeros,A stunned Jorah admits he does ; the stranger before them is one of the most skilled fighters in Westeros : Ser Barristan Selmy , Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon 's Kingsguard .
Westeros,Aemon then orders Sam to begin writing letters immediately and make sure that all forty-four of Castle Black 's ravens are well-fed , as every one of them is to fly that night : the White Walkers have returned , and Westeros must be warned .

Westeros,Barristan says she 'll have good men to advise her , though he respectfully warns that it might not be well for her to be seen with Jorah at her side when they return to Westeros ; Jorah admits that he may never be rid of the moral taint of selling slaves , which is abhorred in Westeros .

Westeros,Dany is forced to reconcile her desire to conquer Westeros with Drogo 's savagery after the Dothraki raid a peaceful village .
Westeros,Gilly tells Tarly that the ship 's captain says that Oldtown is the most beautiful city in Westeros .
Westeros,He adds that Daenerys needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons , as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of Westeros .
Westeros,He also advises Daenerys that conquering Yunkai does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake Westeros .
Westeros,He explains that he is eager to bring Dorne back into the fold , wanting to unite the Seven Kingdoms against more obvious threats ; the Greyjoys are in rebellion , a Wildling army is advancing on the Wall , and there is a Targaryen girl in the East with a powerful army and three dragons , who will eventually threaten Westeros .
Westeros,He hopes the White Walkers ca n't climb the Wall as there is not enough Dragonglass or Valyrian steel in Westeros to combat them .
Westeros,He starts to leave and states his plan to take his own life well before the greyscale envelops him , but Daenerys tearfully commands him to find a cure and come back to her side when she conquers Westeros .
Westeros,He suggests that she will be able to win her throne should she reach Westeros with just a single ship .
Westeros,He wants Jon to convince Mance Rayder to bend the knee and have the wildlings fight for him ; in exchange , he would set them free and give them their own land within Westeros .
Westeros,Her brother , Viserys , callously plans to win Drogo 's allegiance with the marriage , so that he may return home to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne , which was seized by force from his father by Robert .
Westeros,However , Locke refused the offer ; still under the misapprehension that Tarth owns every sapphire mine in Westeros , Locke is convinced Lord Selwyn is trying to cheat him .
Westeros,However , he considers it to be too risky an investment - considering that she has no army and has no open supporters in Westeros - and she receives nothing .
Westeros,In Qarth , Daenerys Targaryen tries to negotiate with the Spice King for ships to return to Westeros .
Westeros,Khal Drogo will not invade Westeros until his son is born and pronounced healthy , which is still many months away .
Westeros,Kraznys tells Daenerys , via Missandei 's interpretation in the Low Valyrian language , that many of the Unsullied have not yet seen battle , so she would do well to attack some minor cities and towns here and there on her way to Westeros .
Westeros,Mance ruefully notes that the giant was named Mag the Mighty , and he was `` king '' of the giants , the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the First Men entered Westeros , to which Jon then glibly notes that his friend Grenn was from a farm .
Westeros,Mormont announces that they must retreat back to the Wall , not simply to save their own lives but because Castle Black and the rest of Westeros must be warned of the coming threat - otherwise everyone they 've ever known will die .
Westeros,Ned 's position is already precarious due to a disagreement with King Robert Baratheon over plans to assassinate Daenerys before she can rally the Dothraki to invade Westeros .
Westeros,Razdal tries a different tact , asserting there is no need for their factions to fight , that Yunkai is willing to overlook her attack on Astapor and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to Westeros .
Westeros,Revealing a trick up his sleeve , he then proposes to marry Daenerys Targaryen and then carry her army and dragons back to Westeros .
Westeros,Robert agrees , but if they land and the knights of Westeros take shelter behind their castle walls , the Dothraki could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept Viserys as their king regardless .
Westeros,Sam reassures Olly that Jon knows what he is doing , and that unless he is successful , neither the Night 's Watch nor Westeros stands a chance against the White Walkers .
Westeros,Sansa will be alone with the Boltons but he explains his plan to her : Stannis will have to attack the Boltons soon if he is to beat the winter snows , and he bets that Stannis will probably win , because he is one of the best military commanders in all of Westeros , and the Boltons will be outnumbered by Stannis , as the other northern houses would be quick to betray their liege lord .
Westeros,She announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best men , sail around Westeros , besiege the Dreadfort , and liberate Theon .
Westeros,She is irritated to learn that Daario Naharis has captured Meereen 's navy without her explicit orders to do so , but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for Westeros and taking King 's Landing with her 8,000 Unsullied and 2,000 Second Sons .
Westeros,Stannis argues that the sacrifice of one bastard boy will usher in his victory , which Stannis believes is the only way to save every man , woman and child in Westeros from the coming darkness that will devour everything in its path .
Westeros,Stannis asks who she would have chosen , Rhaenyra or Aegon , and she says she would n't have chosen either - it was all of the choosing sides that plunged Westeros into civil war .
Westeros,The great lords of the Seven Kingdoms each declared for one or the other , dividing the realm in half , and tearing Westeros apart .
Westeros,The topic of just why Tyrion was even in Volantis comes up , and Tyrion is surprised that Jorah did not ask earlier : he explains that he actually fled from Westeros because he killed his own father Tywin .
Westeros,They fly about their ship as it approaches the city , plucking fish from the sea and roasting them in mid-air with their fire-breath.She notes that they are still not big enough to use as weapons of war to invade Westeros with , and that she needs an army .
Westeros,To finance the war to come , they must raid villages and take people to sell into slavery , thereby gaining the money to hire ships for the khalasar to assault Westeros .
Westeros,Tyrion , however , manages to successfully persuade him that Jorah is one of the most skilled knights in Westeros , and would fetch a better price being sold to the fighting pits in Meereen , which have just reopened .
Westeros,Tyrion counters that no one will support her in Westeros , but Daenerys somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her .
Westeros,Tyrion generously assumes that this will happen ( which it generally does n't ) , but then he reminds Daenerys that Meereen has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the Great Masters and the smallfolk , and extends this to Westeros and its Great Houses .
Westeros,Tywin observes that only the Dornish successfully resisted Aegon Targaryen 's dragons during his invasion of Westeros three centuries ago ; Oberyn dryly notes it must be hard for Tywin to admit he needs the Dornish for help .
Westeros,Tywin states that this will confirm that the Vale of Arryn , which has been neutral in the war up to now , will not support Robb Stark , who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies ( other marriage alliances , with House Tyrell of the Reach and House Martell of Dorne , combined with the crushing of the Baratheons , have in turn secured the rest of southern Westeros under Lannister control ) .
Westeros,Ultimately , half of Westeros rebelled against him , so Aerys had his pyromancers place caches of wildfire all over King 's Landing : under the Great Sept of Baelor , under the slums of Flea Bottom , under houses , stables , taverns , and even under the Red Keep itself .
Westeros,Under the burning Red Comet in the sky , war grips the continent of Westeros .
Westeros,Varys states that Westeros is mired in chaos and on the brink of ruin ; the Seven Kingdoms requires a ruler , one stronger than Tommen yet gentler than Stannis , beloved by the people , able to please the common folk and keep the nobility in line .
Westeros,Varys tells Tyrion that he and Illyrio Mopatis had worked together in secret to restore House Targaryen to the rule of Westeros , but that their errors have left them in Pentos , unable to return to King 's Landing .
Westeros,Viserys Targaryen accompanies the khalasar , meaning to stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and provides him with an army with which to invade Westeros , despite Ser Jorah Mormont 's suggestion .
Westeros,When he received word that Eddard meant to execute him for the crime ( slavery has been illegal in Westeros for centuries ) , he fled to Essos .
Westeros,Xaro offers to fund Daenerys 's invasion of Westeros in exchange for her hand in marriage .
Westeros,Yara then suggests building a massive fleet to attack and make their mark on Westeros .

Westerosi,Ser Jorah Mormont and Rakharo compare the Westerosi and Dothraki ways of battle ; the heavily-armored but slow knights versus the lightly-armored but fast-moving horse-warriors .
Westoros,Illyrio and Viserys discuss the quest to sail back to Westoros , and Viserys inquirers when the wedding will take place .

White Walkers,Grenn and Edd are shoveling pig-shit , but the former rapist Rast urges them that they are not safe here and can not trust Craster : the man sacrifices his own newborn sons to the White Walkers , and there 's every probability that if the White Walkers do come , he 'll hand over the Night 's Watch survivors to his real masters .

Will,Will , in extreme horror , sees the dead wildling girl from earlier now walking with blue eyes , and also witnesses Gared 's death , with the White Walker tossing his severed head at Will 's feet .

Winterfell,Catelyn notes that she said they were riding for Winterfell often and loudly .

Winterfell,He tells her that he will get her out of King 's Landing and to Winterfell as a recruit of the Night 's Watch , but he warns her not to trust the other recruits , since apparently half would hand her over to Cersei for a pardon , while the other half would do the same , but only after raping her first .

Winterfell,In the woods , Brienne fills Sansa in on her encounter with Arya , whilst Sansa is reluctant to talk about her experiences under Ramsay Bolton 's tyranny at Winterfell .
Winterfell,It was in fact Ramsay Snow and his soldiers from House Bolton who burned Winterfell to the ground : he simply sent false reports for his father Roose to deliver to Robb Stark which claimed that the ironborn were responsible , as the Boltons were preparing to betray the Starks months before the Red Wedding .
Winterfell,Jaime deduces that Brienne is n't from the North because he would have noticed her at Winterfell when he visited there , so ( as she is from House Tarth ) she must be a Baratheon supporter .

Winterfell,Robb plans to relieve Winterfell by turning Theon 's men against him with an offer of mercy , issuing his orders to the bastard of the Dreadfort through Roose Bolton .

Winterfell,Second , Roose delivers a letter from his bastard son Ramsay Snow , stating that the ironborn torched Winterfell and put all of its inhabitants to the sword , and then fled all before his force arrived there .
Winterfell,She also tells him that King Robert Baratheon and much of the royal court rides for Winterfell .
Winterfell,She entreats him to assist Stannis in retaking Winterfell , pointing out that even if he does n't become a Stark , his familiarity with the castle could win them the battle .
Winterfell,She explains that war is now imminent and the men ( and thus her customer base ) of Winterfell are destined to leave soon and probably never return ; her departure is thus an economically essential decision .
Winterfell,She tearfully wonders if her sons Bran and Rickon similarly watched at Winterfell for her return when she failed to arrive to save them .

Winterfell,The parties depart Winterfell : Jon , Tyrion and Benjen Stark to the Wall ; and Eddard , Arya , Sansa and the royal party south to King 's Landing .
Winterfell,The party sets out to return to Winterfell .
Winterfell,The two parties depart Winterfell .

Winterfell,Tyrion Lannister stops at Winterfell on his way back to King 's Landing and gets a frosty reception from Robb Stark , despite an act of kindness for Bran .

Yunkai,Daario and Jorah debate how to take Yunkai .
Yunkai,Daenerys Targaryen 's army marches on to the next great city of Slaver 's Bay , Yunkai .
Yunkai,Daenerys makes a counter-offer : she will spare the lives of Razdal and the slave-masters of Yunkai if every slave ( men , women and children ) in the city is set free , and given as much food , clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services .
Yunkai,Daenerys tells Jorah to find out more about Yunkai 's `` powerful friends '' before she commits herself to an attack on the city .
Yunkai,Dany exchanges gifts with a slave lord outside of Yunkai .
Yunkai,Dany however is adamant on freeing the slaves of Yunkai , who number in the hundreds of thousands .
Yunkai,He also advises Daenerys that conquering Yunkai does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake Westeros .
Yunkai,He presents Yunkai 's torn flag and triumphantly says the city is hers .
Yunkai,Her advisors then reveal more troubling news : the Wise Masters have bounced back and re-enslaved every freed man in Yunkai , and although Astapor remains free , the council Daenerys installed has been deposed by a butcher named Cleon .
Yunkai,Hizdahr zo Loraq and Daario Naharis return to Meereen and declare that their mission to Yunkai has been successful , and that the Wise Masters will turn over power to a council of former slaves and former slave owners .
Yunkai,In Slaver 's Bay , Daenerys Targaryen 's new army of freed Unsullied , having just sacked Astapor , head north to the next of the three great slaver-cities , Yunkai .
Yunkai,In exchange , they ask that Daenerys leave Yunkai in peace .
Yunkai,Jorah and Grey Worm finally enter , covered in dust and gore but grinning widely : Yunkai is defeated .
Yunkai,Missandei announces the newcomer as Razdal mo Eraz , one of the ruling `` Wise Masters '' of Yunkai .
Yunkai,Outside the walls of Yunkai , Daenerys Targaryen and her advisors wait for the city 's slaves to appear .
Yunkai,Outside the walls of Yunkai , Daenerys Targaryen and her commanders plan an attack on the city .
Yunkai,Razdal declares that Yunkai was an ancient civilization long before the rise of Valyria and that numerous armies throughout history have tried and failed to conquer it .
Yunkai,Razdal takes offense , promising that Yunkai will be more of a challenge for her than Astapor or Qarth , and threatens her with the retribution of Yunkai 's `` powerful friends '' who he claims will take great pleasure in destroying her army and enslaving the survivors .
Yunkai,Razdal tries a different tact , asserting there is no need for their factions to fight , that Yunkai is willing to overlook her attack on Astapor and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to Westeros .
Yunkai,Ser Jorah notes with wisdom however that Yunkai 's defenders wo n't fight them in open battle , being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the Targaryen army with guerrilla tactics .
Yunkai,She and Barristan Selmy are confident they can take the city , given that Yunkai are famous for training bed slaves rather than soldiers .
Yunkai,She orders Grey Worm to send a messenger to the city and inform Yunkai 's slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as Astapor .
Yunkai,She warns that if her offer is rejected , Yunkai will be shown no mercy .
Yunkai,That night Ser Jorah , Daario , and Grey Worm sneak into the city and fight their way through the slave soldiers guarding Yunkai .
Yunkai,The Second Sons will be stationed in Yunkai to enforce whichever choice the masters make .
