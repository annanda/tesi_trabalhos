<en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> makes a difficult decision in <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> recruits the help of an unexpected ally. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> searches for <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> remains under <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s control.
In <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>
<en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en>     <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> watches on as her dragons set a head of great family on fire and proceed to eat him.   watches over the wounded <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en>, who is still unconscious from his wounds sustained by the <en name='Sons of the Harpy' type='other'>Sons of the Harpy</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> and <en name='Daario Naharis' type='other'>Daario Naharis</en> wake over the deceased <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Ser Barristan Selmy</en>. <en name='Hizdahr' type='other'>Hizdahr</en> zo <en name='Loraq' type='other'>Loraq</en> enters to extend his condolences. <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> suggests pulling back around the pyramid to use it as a base from which to eradicate the <en name='Sons of the Harpy' type='other'>Sons of the Harpy</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> instead opts for rounding up the leaders of each great family in <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, including <en name='Hizdahr' type='other'>Hizdahr</en>. The leaders are brought to the catacombs where <en name='Rhaegal' type='other'>Rhaegal</en> and <en name='Viserion' type='other'>Viserion</en> are chained up. <en name='Daenerys 's Unsullied' type='other'>Daenerys 's Unsullied</en> push the leaders slowly towards the two dragons, who can be heard growling from the darkness. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> states that good mothers do not give up on their children, they discipline them if needed, but never give up on them. She nods to <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> to push one of the leaders further forward. A stream of fire coming from <en name='Rhaegal' type='other'>Rhaegal</en> sets the man aflame before he is torn apart and eaten by both dragons. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> suggests that the dragons may determine the innocence of the captives and touches <en name='Hizdahr' type='other'>Hizdahr</en>'s back as if she wanted to push him but then she pretends she wants not to overfeed the dragons and lets the rest of the men be led away.
<en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> wakes up later with <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> sitting beside him. He asks if <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='other'>Barristan Selmy</en> survived the attack by the <en name='Sons of the Harpy' type='other'>Sons of the Harpy</en> but <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> shakes her head. <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> thinks he has failed <en name='Barristan' type='person'>Ser Barristan</en>, his men and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> -- a claim <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> denies. <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> tells him he shouldn't be ashamed for being wounded given that he was ambushed and outnumbered, but <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> says he is ashamed that he was afraid when he was stabbed. <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> says that everyone fears death. However, <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> says it isn't death he fears, it is the thought of never getting to see <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> again that terrified him. <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> is noticeably touched and kisses <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en>.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> asks <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> whether she should reopen the fighting pits. <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> only says that she has seen <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> listening to her counselors when her own experience was lacking and ignoring them when she thought they were wrong. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> visits the imprisoned <en name='Hizdahr' type='other'>Hizdahr</en>, who begs for his life. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> tells him she has decided to reopen the fighting pits, but only for free men. She also says that she will marry the head of an ancient family of <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> to forge a bond with the people of the city, and that she luckily has one of them on his knees already. She leaves a very confused <en name='Hizdahr' type='other'>Hizdahr</en> to ponder that he will live, and that he will soon be <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>'s prince consort.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en>  <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> reads a note from <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en> to <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> updating him on <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s situation. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> praises <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s courage but <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> worries about his great-niece's safety because she is all alone, under siege, and with hardly anyone to guide her, while her "last relation" is useless and dying thousands of miles away. <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> enters to speak with <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> in private. He needs the maester's advice on a controversial order that many of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> will hate him for. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> tells <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that half the men at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> already hate him, but that he should trust in his command. He says that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> will not enjoy being <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en>, but with luck, he may find the strength to do what needs to be done. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is told to "kill the boy, and let the man be born."
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> then meets with <en name='Tormund Giantsbane' type='other'>Tormund Giantsbane</en> and offers to forge an alliance with the wildlings, bidding <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> to go north of the wall and rally them all. He will open the gates for them and give them land south of the wall in which to settle. In return, the wildlings will fight alongside the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> when <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> arrive. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> is initially reluctant and to convince him, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> unlocks his chains, freeing him. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> relents, and reveals that most of the wildlings are up at <en name='Hardhome' type='other'>Hardhome</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> offers him horses and men to bring the wildlings back. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> tells him that they'll need ships to bring his people back, which <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> says he'll borrow from <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en>'s final condition is that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> accompany him as a guarantee that the wildlings will not fall prey to any traps set by the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>.
The men of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> do not take news of the alliance well, citing the countless innocent lives lost due to the wildlings. Even <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s friend <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> rejects this decision, stating that the wildlings killed their friends <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> and <en name='Pyp' type='other'>Pyp</en>. Nevertheless, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> decides to go ahead with his plan. In the library, <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> tells <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> about his wish to go to <en name='Citadel' type='other'>Citadel</en> and become a maester before he was sent to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, when <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en> walks in. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> reminisces about how <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>'s father, <en name='Randyll Tarly' type='other'>Randyll Tarly</en>, defeated <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en> in the <en name='Battle of Ashford' type='other'>Battle of Ashford</en>. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> wants to know how <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> killed the <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> and <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> tells him how he did it with a dagger made of dragonglass. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> muses that it is abundantly available in <en name='Dragonstone' type='place'>Dragonstone</en>. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> has been researching dragonglass and how it can kill <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>, but has yet to come up with anything. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> tells him to continue his research and leaves.
Later, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> tells <en name='Davos' type='person'>Ser Davos</en> that they will march toward <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> the next morning. <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> suggests waiting until <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> returns with the wildlings, but <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> decides against it, as any delay improves the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en>' chances. He also wants to take <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en> and <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en> with them, as he does not think they will be safe at the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, surrounded by criminals. The next morning, <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s army, with <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> and <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> at its head, starts its journey to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
<en name='Brienne of Tarth' type='other'>Brienne of Tarth</en> and <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en>, still pursuing <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>, arrive at an inn near <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> thinks that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> may be better off at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> now that she is far away from the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>, but <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> believes that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> will not be safe around the people who murdered her mother and brother - the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en>. Their conversation is interrupted by a servant. Correctly suspecting that he is still loyal to the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en>, <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> tells of her allegiance to <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en> and convinces the servant to get a message through to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>  -  her presence still being something of a secret, the old servant seems to gain strength from the idea of a surviving <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en>.
In <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay Bolton</en> and his bedwarmer <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> discuss <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s upcoming marriage to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>. <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> admits her jealousy of <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, especially since he had promised to marry <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> back when he was a bastard. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> disregards <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en>'s insecurities, causing <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> to proclaim that perhaps she will marry too. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> is angered and violently tells her that she is his and she is not going anywhere unless she continues to bore him with her jealousy. He threateningly reminds her what he does to people who bore him, and hearing this <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> swears never to bore him again.
Meanwhile, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s maid carries a message to her. Consoling <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> that she still has allies in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>, she tells <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to light a candle in the highest window of the <en name='Broken Tower' type='other'>Broken Tower</en> if she ever needs help. As <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> wanders around the castle, coming to the tower where <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en> pushed her brother <en name='Brandon' type='other'>Brandon</en> out of the window, she runs into <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en>. <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> puts on a friendly façade, talking to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> about her mother's demise. To help <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> "remember" how things used to be, <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> leads <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> down to the kennels, where she finds <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>, formerly <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en>, asleep in one of the cages. Awoken by <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s arrival, he just shakes his head, when <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> calls him "<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>." He warns her that she shouldn't be down there. Seeing <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> in such a pitiful condition, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> angrily storms away.
<en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> at the "family" dinner.  As <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> helps <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> get ready for dinner, he confesses to <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> that earlier that day, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> saw him in his cage. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, for his own amusement, makes it seem as though he's going to punish <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> severely, before simply forgiving him. At dinner, <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> is initially well-behaved, toasting his wedding to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, but is soon back to his old ways as he forces <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> to apologize to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> for murdering <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>. With much difficulty, <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> finally mutters an apology. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> then suggests that <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> be the one to give <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> away at the wedding, since he is the closest thing <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> has to kin and <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> accepts the suggestion. Seeing that <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> is getting complacent, however, <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> has <en name='Walda Bolton' type='person'>Walda</en> announce that she is pregnant with a boy. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> is clearly distressed by the news, which in turn delights <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>.
<en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> tells <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> about his conception.
After dinner, <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> expresses his distress at the possibility of the unborn child jeopardizing his claim on the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>. <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> reprimands his son for disgracing himself at dinner but seemingly dismisses his concern. He then shares the story of <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s birth; <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> raped a miller's wife, who had married without his consent, after hanging her husband. A year later, she showed up with <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, claiming that the baby was his. <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> nearly had her whipped and the baby drowned, but when <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> laid eyes upon <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, he was convinced that he was his son and decided to keep him. He then reveals to <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> that <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> has an army at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> plans to take the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> and the road to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> passes through <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, which means that <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> also intends to take the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>. He wants <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s help in defeating <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>, and <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> agrees.
<en name='Old Valyria' type='other'>Old Valyria</en>
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> are attacked by the <en name='Stonemen' type='other'>Stonemen</en>
As <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> continue their journey to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, and following <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>'s violent reaction to a previous conversation, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are. As <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of <en name='Old Valyria' type='other'>Old Valyria</en>, a shorter route to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> and one which pirates will avoid because of <en name='Valyria' type='other'>Valyria</en>'s reputation. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is apprehensive, but still excited to see the ruins of what was once the greatest civilization in the world.
As they catch glimpses of domes, towers and aqueducts, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> recites a poem about the <en name='Doom of Valyria' type='other'>Doom of Valyria</en>, with <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> joining in at the end. Suddenly, through the fog, they see <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> fly into view. Although he had been hearing about the dragons for some time, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is still utterly gobsmacked to see one in person. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> is struck silent too, as <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> is even bigger and more majestic than when he left. So distracted are they that they don't notice when the statues on a nearby aqueduct stand up and leap at the boat: they are <en name='Stone Men' type='other'>Stone Men</en> - victims of greyscale so far gone that they have been sent to live out the rest of their lives in quarantine in the ruins. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> not to let them touch him and fights them off.  However, as <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is tied up, he is cornered at one end of the boat with a stone man advancing on him while <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> battles more at the other end.  Just before the stone man is able to grab him, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> rolls off of the boat and into the water to escape, where he is then pulled down by more stone men under the water.
An undetermined amount of time later, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> wakes up and finds himself on a shore, dragged out of the water by <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>. After confirming to each other that they had not been touched by the stone men, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he hopes to find a fishing village and get a boat soon, otherwise they'll have to walk all the way around <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en> to eventually reach <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> seems up for it and <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> goes to look for firewood so they can make camp. However, once out of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s view, he pulls back his sleeve to inspect the cracked skin on his wrist, confirming that he had been infected with greyscale during the fight with the stone men. He looks at <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and then glances in the direction of <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, knowing that even if he dies, he needs to get <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>.
