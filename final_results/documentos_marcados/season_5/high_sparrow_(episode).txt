In <en name='Braavos' type='place'>Braavos</en>, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> sees the <en name='Many-Faced God' type='other'>Many-Faced God</en>. In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Queen Margaery</en> enjoys her new husband. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> walk the <en name='Long Bridge of Volantis' type='other'>Long Bridge of Volantis</en>.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> and <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> are wed.  As <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei Lannister</en> passes a large crowd on her way to the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en>, she is increasingly annoyed as people cheer on <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, completely ignoring her. <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen Baratheon</en> and <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery Tyrell</en> are wed, much to the dismay of <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>. That night, they consummate their marriage. They are elated and discuss their future together. <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> thinks that his mother is unhappy in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. Seeing an opportunity, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> manipulates <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> into thinking that as long as <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> stays in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, she will continue to treat him like a child, watching over him. The next morning, <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> are out for a walk. <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> tells his mother that he thinks she should return to <en name='Casterly Rock' type='place'>Casterly Rock</en> if it will make her happy, since she used to talk so fondly of it, but <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> declines. Deducing that this is <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>'s doing, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> pays her a visit, to find <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> busy gloating about her "exhausting" night with the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en>. Greeting her mother-in-law, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> now more confident than ever, subtly rubs her queenship in <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s face. Seeing herself losing, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> walks away.
In <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>'s brothel, the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en> attack the <en name='High Septon' type='other'>High Septon</en> as he engages the services of prostitutes dressed as the <en name='Seven' type='other'>Seven</en>. He is forced to walk naked through the streets while the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en> proclaim him a sinner. Angered by the humiliation, he wants the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> to arrest the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en> and execute their leader, the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en>. Although unsympathetic, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> decides to meet with the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en>, who turns out to be a humble man serving food to the poor, barefoot. <en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> makes no efforts to hide the actions of the other <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> tells him that he will not be arrested or executed, and that the <en name='High Septon' type='other'>High Septon</en> has been imprisoned instead, which surprises the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en>. Returning to the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> has <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> send a message to <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en>. As <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> writes, behind him, the body of <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor Clegane</en> begins shaking under the sheet, but <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> shushes him calmly.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
While being served lunch by <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>, <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> scolds <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> on his recent flaying of <en name='Cerwyn' type='person'>Lord Cerwyn</en> and his family on what was supposed to be a routine tax collection. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> points out that he eventually got the taxes, but <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> reminds his son that terror cannot sustain their hold on the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> and that they are outnumbered if the other houses rise up in rebellion. With <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en>'s death, the pact between the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> and the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en> is effectively dead. <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> then declares that the best way to cement <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> control of the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> is through marriage.
<en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> is horrified to see <en name='Moat Cailin' type='other'>Moat Cailin</en>. There is only one reason <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> could be taking her there - he means to return her to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, straight into the arms of the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en>. Recalling their earlier discussion of a marriage proposal, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> realizes that the proposal is not for him, but for her, and furiously declares that she would rather die than marry <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en>. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> corrects her and clarifies that she will be marrying <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay Bolton</en>, then calms her down by convincing her that nobody will look for her there, and suggesting that this is her best opportunity for revenge. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> reluctantly agrees.
<en name='The Boltons' type='other'>The Boltons</en> greet <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>  At <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> itself, the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en> and their households greet <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>. After a tense moment, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> graciously accepts <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en>'s welcome, putting on an air of politeness that protected her in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, while from afar, <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s bedwarmer and secret lover, <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en>, observes with jealousy and anger. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is later shown to her old room, seemingly foreign to her after all this time. To her surprise, the servant attending her welcomes her back and quietly assures her that, "the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> remembers." Later, as <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> explores the castle, <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> hides his face from her, but seems to have difficulty forcing himself not to call out to her.
Elsewhere in the castle, <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> subtly warns <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> against inflicting any harm on <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, and discusses the situation with <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en>, who is suspicious of <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>'s motives in betraying the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> points out that <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is dead, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is one-handed and politically useless, and that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is about to be forced into the background by <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, who is quite fond of <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>. <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en>, nevertheless, demands to read any messages <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> might send off back to the <en name='Capital' type='other'>Capital</en>.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>King Stannis Baratheon</en> tries unsuccessfully to convince the new <en name='Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch' type='other'>Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch</en>, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>, to accept his offer of legitimization. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> declines <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s offer and reiterates that his place is with the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> also reiterates the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>'s neutrality in the affairs of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en> and asks <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> when he plans to leave; <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>'s stores are insufficient to feed the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s army, and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> confirms that his army will leave soon enough to confront the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en> at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> before the winter snows trap them at the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>. He leaves the fate of the wildling prisoners in <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s hands, allowing <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to decide whether to execute them or to see if <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> is more willing to negotiate than <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>. When <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> suggests appointing <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='other'>Alliser Thorne</en> as the new commander of <en name='Eastwatch-by-the-Sea' type='other'>Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</en>, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> retorts that "it is better to have your enemies close by than far away." As <en name='Davos Seaworth' type='other'>Davos Seaworth</en> prepares to leave with his liege, he invites <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to ponder on the second-to-last stanza on the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> oath: "I am the shield that guards the realms of men." He also assures <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s leadership advice is offered because the king has taken a liking to him.
Later, at the mess hall, <en name='Jon Snow' type='person'>Lord Commander Jon Snow</en> asks <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> about <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> and it is learned his health is waning and entrusts his care in <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>'s hands. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> begins assigning roles to members of the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>. He assigns one black brother to oversee the digging of a new latrine pit to accommodate the wildling prisoners. <en name='Snow' type='other'>Snow</en> also shows respect to <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Ser Alliser Thorne</en> by appointing him as the new <en name='First Ranger' type='other'>First Ranger</en>, commending his experience. Finally, <en name='Snow' type='person'>Lord Commander Snow</en> assigns <en name='Janos Slynt' type='other'>Janos Slynt</en> with the task of restoring and manning the abandoned castle <en name='Greyguard' type='other'>Greyguard</en>. <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en> refuses <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> not once, but three times. Even after being warned that he is disobeying a direct order, he flippantly tells <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that he can take his order and 'shove it up his bastard arse.' Having publicly disobeyed and insulted <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, the <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en> orders <en name='Janos' type='other'>Janos</en> taken outside, and calls for <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en> to fetch him his sword. <en name='Alliser' type='person'>Ser Alliser</en> briefly hesitates but then moves out of the way to let <en name='Dolorous Edd' type='other'>Dolorous Edd</en> and others grab <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en>, who angrily protests that he has important friends at court and dismisses the matter as a scare tactic.
Small justice for <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en>.
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> has <en name='Janos' type='other'>Janos</en> dragged out into the courtyard where, obedient to the laws of his father <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - he prepares to publicly behead him for treason. <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en>'s bluster is lost, and the man who once took a baby girl from her mother's arms and killed her starts crying and begging for mercy, saying he will do whatever <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> asks and that he is afraid. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> hesitates for a moment, but then fixes his nerve and executes the cowardly former <en name='Commander of the City Watch' type='other'>Commander of the City Watch</en> with a single swing of his sword - incidentally exacting small justice on one of the men who betrayed his own father to his death and murdered <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en>'s children. From across the courtyard, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en> sees <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> behead <en name='Janos' type='other'>Janos</en> for refusing his orders, and slightly nods in approval.
In the <en name='Free Cities' type='place'>Free Cities</en>
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is accosted by <en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en>  In <en name='Braavos' type='place'>Braavos</en>, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> has been put to work cleaning the main sanctuary of the <en name='House of Black' type='place'>House of Black</en> and <en name='White' type='other'>White</en>. She watches as <en name='Jaqen H'ghar' type='other'>Jaqen H'ghar</en> assists a supplicant in drinking from the temple's well. She protests to <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> that she wants to learn, but he brushes off her discontent. Later on, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is accosted in her room by <en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en>, who repeatedly asks her who she is, hitting her when she gives the expected response of "no one." <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> eventually arrives and demands to know what is going on, as the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en> has overstepped her bounds. He does, however, point out that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> cannot be no one, as she is wearing <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en>'s clothes, is in possession of silver stolen by <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en>, and was about to attack the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en> using <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en>'s sword. Realizing his point, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> binds her old clothing to a rock and tosses it into the lagoon along with the stolen silver. She cannot bring herself to discard <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en> so easily, and instead hides it within a sea wall nearby. Back at the <en name='House' type='other'>House</en>, <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> allows <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> to progress to an inner chamber where she is to assist the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en> in stripping and washing corpses. <en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en> is silent when <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> asks what happens to the bodies after they are cleaned.
<en name='The Red Priestess' type='other'>The Red Priestess</en>
Meanwhile, further south in the <en name='Free Cities' type='place'>Free Cities</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> finally arrive at <en name='Volantis' type='other'>Volantis</en>. Sick of the carriage they've been riding in, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> again dismisses the dangers and insists they leave to explore. The pair move through the <en name='Long Bridge' type='other'>Long Bridge</en>'s markets, where <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> explains the meaning of the various tattoos <en name='Volantene' type='other'>Volantene</en> slaves must sport. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> nearly loses <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, but finds him observing the sermon of a <en name='Red Priestess' type='other'>Red Priestess</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> claims curiosity, since <en name='Thoros of Myr' type='other'>Thoros of Myr</en> was the only <en name='Red Priest' type='other'>Red Priest</en> in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. <en name='The Red Priestess' type='other'>The Red Priestess</en> evangelizes in <en name='High Valyrian' type='other'>High Valyrian</en>, telling the tale of how she was once a slave herself. Like another <en name='Red Priestess' type='other'>Red Priestess</en>, she preaches of a prophesied savior, a <en name='Dragon Queen' type='other'>Dragon Queen</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s interest in the scene wanes when the <en name='Priestess' type='other'>Priestess</en> halts in her sermon and stares directly into his eyes.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> next leads <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> to a brothel. <en name='Cat' type='other'>Cat</en>ching sight of a prostitute dressed as <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> woos a dark-haired prostitute, but when she finally agrees to service him, he finds that he can't bring himself to patronize her. He then goes to urinate off the side of the bridge, with <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> losing sight of him. As <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> finishes, he is abducted by <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah Mormont</en>, who declares that he is taking him to "the queen."
