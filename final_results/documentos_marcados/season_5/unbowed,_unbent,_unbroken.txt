In <en name='Braavos' type='place'>Braavos</en>
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> continues her training with the <en name='Faceless Men' type='other'>Faceless Men</en>. She cleans a corpse methodically, which is then taken away by two men. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is obviously curious about what is on the other side of the door through which the corpse was taken. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is about to walk through the door when the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en> obstructs her path and latches the door. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> wants to know what happens to the bodies she scrubs clean, but the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en> tells her that she will know when the time is right. Frustrated at the lack of answers, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> demands to play the game of faces. <en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en> tells her that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> has already tried playing the game but failed. She again asks <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> who she is, to which <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> replies that she is no one. <en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en> simply tells <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> to get back to work and is about to walk away when <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> asks her who she is. <en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en> tells <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> a story about how she was the only daughter of a widowed <en name='Lord' type='other'>Lord</en>, who remarried, producing another daughter. Her stepmother, in order to secure her own daughter's future, tried to poison her. <en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en> found out about this and sought out the help of the <en name='Faceless Men' type='other'>Faceless Men</en> to exact her revenge. <en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en> then asks <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> whether she believed the story, surprising <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>. When <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> doesn't respond, embarrassed that she bought the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en>'s story, the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en> tells her to get back to work, hinting to <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> that to pass the game of faces, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> must be able to lie convincingly. Later, when <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is asleep, <en name='Jaqen H'ghar' type='other'>Jaqen H'ghar</en> comes to test <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> again. This time, when he asks <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> who she is, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> tells him how she came to join the <en name='Faceless Men' type='other'>Faceless Men</en>, trying to slip in a few lies into the story. However, <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> is able to tell when <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is lying and hits her with a switch whenever she does. He strikes her repeatedly when she insists she hated the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>. Before he leaves, he tells her that she is lying not only to him, but to herself as well.
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> in the <en name='Hall of Faces' type='other'>Hall of Faces</en>.
A grieving father brings his sickly daughter to the <en name='House of Black' type='place'>House of Black</en> and <en name='White' type='other'>White</en>. He explains to <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> that he has been to every healer in <en name='Braavos' type='place'>Braavos</en> and spent every penny he had. He tells her that his daughter is suffering and needs to find peace. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> sits besides the girl and tells her a short false story, about how she was sick too, but her father brought her here and when she drank from the temple's well, she was healed. This persuades the sickly girl to drink the poisoned water from the well. The water gives the peace of death to the sickly girl, and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, having successfully proven that she can lie, is brought to the <en name='Hall of Faces' type='other'>Hall of Faces</en> with <en name='Jaqen H'ghar' type='other'>Jaqen H'ghar</en>, a great underground chamber that houses thousands of faces. All the faces had been taken from the corpses that the acolytes wash in the temple. <en name='The Faceless Man' type='other'>The Faceless Man</en> then asks <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> if she is ready to give up who she is to become "no one". After a moment of silence, he then states that she is not ready to become "no one" (she is too attached to her past as a <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en>), but that she is ready to become "someone else".
In <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>
<en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> in <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>
On the western side of <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> and <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah Mormont</en> are still making their way to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> (on the far opposite eastern side of the region) on foot, after losing their boat passing through the <en name='Smoking Sea' type='other'>Smoking Sea</en> and the ruins of <en name='Old Valyria' type='other'>Old Valyria</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is annoyed that they didn't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> had hoped, so they're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat. The topic of just why <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was even in <en name='Volantis' type='other'>Volantis</en> comes up, and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is surprised that <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> did not ask earlier: he explains that he actually fled from <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> because he killed his own father <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>. He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he didn't commit, and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved - <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> nods, as this seems as likely a motivation for <en name='Kinslaying' type='other'>Kinslaying</en> as any. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then says that despite how miserable <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> is now, at least he can say that he had a good father. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> asks how he could have known his father <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor Mormont</en>, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> explains he visited the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> once and met him: he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men, a rare thing in the world, but now as the eulogy for <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> members goes, "the world will not see his like again." <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> is shocked to realize he means that his father is dead. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> becomes apologetic and says he thought that <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> knew already. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> asks how he died: <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says he only knows the report he heard, which said that his father led an expedition beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, but there was a mutiny, and <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor</en> was murdered by his own men. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> processes this in silent grief, then changes the subject by saying that they have to keep moving.
As they walk, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> asks why <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> would support <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> and how she would be better than any other rulers , or why <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> would even support her, given that her father was the <en name='Mad King' type='other'>Mad King</en>. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> explains that he never used to believe in things like destiny and was very cynical, but after seeing <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> emerge from the flames unharmed with baby dragons, he believes in her now, and the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> is hers by right. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> remains skeptical that this doesn't automatically mean she will be a good queen, given that the <en name='Targaryens' type='other'>Targaryens</en> were famous for going insane, just like <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s own father.
Spotting a slaver ship in the distance, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> pulls <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to the ground. However, the pair has already been spotted before they start hiding, and the slavers emerge from the trees behind them and take them captive. The lead slaver, <en name='Malko' type='other'>Malko</en>, intends to return them back to their destination in <en name='Volantis' type='other'>Volantis</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, however, manages to successfully persuade him that <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> is one of the most skilled knights in <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>, and would fetch a better price being sold to the fighting pits in <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, which have just reopened. Though not in the circumstances they hoped, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> are once again quickly heading towards <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Queen Daenerys</en>.
In <en name='Dorne' type='place'>Dorne</en>
<en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> approach the <en name='Water Gardens' type='other'>Water Gardens</en>, wearing <en name='Martell' type='other'>Martell</en> disguises from the soldiers they killed. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> wonders what <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> will do once they get inside and find <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en>, to which <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> replies that he likes to improvise; <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> sarcastically remarks "That explains the golden hand." Meanwhile, <en name='Ellaria Sand' type='other'>Ellaria Sand</en> and the <en name='Sand Snakes' type='other'>Sand Snakes</en> are already inside the <en name='Gardens' type='other'>Gardens</en>. <en name='Ellaria' type='other'>Ellaria</en> sends them out to abduct <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en>, telling them to do it "for <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en>."
<en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> herself is enjoying another stroll with her betrothed, <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Trystane Martell</en>, <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Trystane</en>'s father <en name='Doran Martell' type='person'>Prince Doran Martell</en> and his bodyguard <en name='Areo Hotah' type='other'>Areo Hotah</en> watch from above. <en name='Doran Martell' type='person'>Doran</en> comments that they look lovely together, but that they don't realize how dangerous their betrothal is, and that he and <en name='Areo' type='other'>Areo</en> must protect them. <en name='Doran Martell' type='person'>Doran</en> asks if <en name='Areo' type='other'>Areo</en> remembers how to uses his longaxe, and <en name='Areo' type='other'>Areo</en> assures him that he does.
<en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> and her intended <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Trystane Martell</en>  <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> infiltrate the <en name='Water Gardens' type='other'>Water Gardens</en> and soon come upon <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> kissing <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Trystane</en>. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> tries to convince <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> to come with him, but <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Trystane</en> interferes, suspicious of the bloodstains on <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> and <en name='Jaime 's Dornish' type='other'>Jaime 's Dornish</en> robes. When <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Trystane</en> tries to draw his sword, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> quickly knocks him down, to <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en>'s horror. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> tries to lead her away, but they are suddenly attacked by the <en name='Sand Snakes' type='other'>Sand Snakes</en>. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> fights against <en name='Tyene' type='other'>Tyene</en> and <en name='Nymeria' type='other'>Nymeria</en>, while <en name='Obara' type='other'>Obara</en> attacks <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> with her spear, driving him away from <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en>. <en name='Obara' type='other'>Obara</en> orders <en name='Nym' type='other'>Nym</en> to break away from <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> and take <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> prisoner, but as <en name='Nym' type='other'>Nym</en> tries to pull her away, they are cut off by <en name='Areo' type='other'>Areo</en> and <en name='Doran Martell' type='person'>Prince Doran</en>'s guards, who surround them and force them all to drop their weapons. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>, <en name='Ellaria' type='other'>Ellaria</en> and the <en name='Sand Snakes' type='other'>Sand Snakes</en> are all taken into custody.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en> arrives in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and is on his way to meet <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> when he is confronted by <en name='Brother Lancel' type='other'>Brother Lancel</en> and some other <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en>. <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> warns <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> that they have purged <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> of its corrupt ways, and the new <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> will not tolerate his prostitution business. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> dismisses these threats.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, meeting with <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>, continues to deny her involvement in <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras Tyrell</en>'s arrest by the <en name='Faith Militant' type='other'>Faith Militant</en>. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> is not fooled and warns that <en name='House Tyrell' type='house'>House Tyrell</en> will not tolerate this insult. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> claims that she is the insulted one since <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras</en>, who was promised to her, prefers the company of men. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> then explains why she summoned <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>; she is suspicious where his loyalties truly lie and asks him whether she can rely on the the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> to fight for the <en name='Throne' type='other'>Throne</en> if the time comes. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> assures her that young <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> heeds his advice and he will always counsel loyalty to the <en name='Throne' type='other'>Throne</en>. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> then reveals that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is back in <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, where <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> has arranged for her to marry <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is infuriated by the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en>' betrayal. To add fuel to the fire, <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> adds that marrying the last remaining <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> gives the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en> a stronger hold over the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> than an alliance with a hated southern house. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> counsels patience and suggests letting the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en> and <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> fight each other, and when the victor is still recovering from the battle, step in and defeat him. He suggests that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s uncle <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan Lannister</en> muster a force or have <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en> lead an army to the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> contemptuously claims that her uncle doesn't have the courage to lead an army, while <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is away on a "sensitive diplomatic mission." <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> proposes that the soldiers of the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> could fight instead but <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is unsure of <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>'s ability to lead an army. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> convinces her, stating that he "lives to serve". All <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> wants in return is to be named <en name='Warden of the North' type='other'>Warden of the North</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> agrees to talk to the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> about this.
<en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna Tyrell</en> returns to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> after learning of her grandson's arrest. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> tries to talks <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> into releasing <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> sticks to her claim that it was the <en name='Faith Militant' type='other'>Faith Militant</en> who arrested <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> and she had nothing to do with it. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> warns <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> that her actions have endangered the <en name='Lannister-Tyrell' type='other'>Lannister-Tyrell</en> alliance  -  the very alliance that is supplying the capital with food. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> informs <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> that the <en name='High Septon' type='other'>High Septon</en> has called for a preliminary hearing to determine whether the charges against <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> have merit and expresses confidence that <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> will be acquitted.
<en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> is arrested.
<en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> interrogates <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> first, who refutes the accusations against him. He then questions <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, who also denies any knowledge of it. <en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> then calls in <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar</en>, in character as <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>'s "squire", who claims that the accusations against <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> are in fact true. <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar</en> also admits that <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> walked in on them once, but didn't seem surprised. To support his testimony, <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar</en> tells the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> of a birthmark <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> has that is shaped like <en name='Dorne' type='place'>Dorne</en>, much to <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>' shock and fury. Deciding that this is more than enough evidence for a trial, the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> has <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> arrested. Since <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> bore false witness before the <en name='Gods' type='other'>Gods</en>, she is arrested too. As <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> is forcefully dragged away, she calls out for <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>, paralyzed with indecision, while <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> sadly regards <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s barely contained smug expression.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
At <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is joined by <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> in her room. She offers to help <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> take a bath, so she is presentable to <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> during the wedding. While she is washing <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s back, <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> mentions three other girls whom <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> had been with, and how he ultimately victimized them after a while because they bored him. Knowing that <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> is trying to frighten her, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> startles <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> by revealing that she knows about her relationship with <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>. She coolly tells <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en> that she is a <en name='Stark of Winterfell' type='other'>Stark of Winterfell</en> and will not be intimidated by the likes of her, and dismisses her to finish her bath herself, though she is visibly shaken by <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en>'s story.
<en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is wed.  Later, when <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> comes to fetch <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> for the wedding, she refuses to hold <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>'s arm, even after he pleads with her to do so, saying that <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> will punish him if she doesn't. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> coldly asks if he thinks she cares what <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> does to him, and strides past him. Then, in front of the <en name='Godswood' type='other'>Godswood</en>, <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> gives <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> away to <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> (who actually allows <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> to call himself <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en>) during the wedding ceremony, which is officiated by <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> and attended by many <en name='Northern Lords' type='other'>Northern Lords</en>. After retreating to the bedroom, <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> orders <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to take her clothes off. <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> is about to leave but <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> tells him he must stay. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> quips to <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>, "You grew up with her as a girl, now watch her become a woman." Annoyed by <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s hesitance, he angrily rips open the back of her dress and pushes her face-down over the side of the bed. As he unbuckles his clothes, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> obediently remains still but begins crying softly. <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> is visibly distraught and begins silently crying himself, as <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> proceeds to rape her, and forcefully consummate their marriage.
