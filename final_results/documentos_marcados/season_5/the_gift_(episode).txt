<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> departs for <en name='Hardhome' type='other'>Hardhome</en> with <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> and a group of rangers, after speaking with <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Ser Alliser Thorne</en> and <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>. Before they leave, <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> gives <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> some of his dragonglass weapons, reminding him of their use against the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>. Afterward, <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> and <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> visit <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en>, who is bedridden and dying from old age. <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> brings her baby <en name='Little Sam' type='other'>Little Sam</en> for him to hold and cheer him up a little. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> happily notes that her son has a laugh just like his little brother <en name='Egg' type='other'>Egg</en> (<en name='Aegon V' type='person'>King Aegon V</en>) had when he was a baby. In a moment of clarity, <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> gravely warns <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> that she and her son must leave the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> while they still can, before winter comes (and the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> with it). <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en>'s condition steadily deteriorates during the night, and he fades in and out of consciousness. Near the end he wakes up delirious from a dream, still lost in memory from his youth: he calls out to his brother <en name='Egg' type='other'>Egg</en>, and says that he had a strange dream that he was an old man. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> passes away soon afterwards.
<en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en> loses his virginity with <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en>.
In the courtyard of <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> eulogizes <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> before lighting his funeral pyre, declaring for all to hear that he was the blood of the dragon - "but now his watch is ended." <en name='Alliser' type='person'>Ser Alliser</en> whispers that <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>'s friends are abandoning him one by one. Afterward, <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> is attacked in the dining hall by two brothers, but <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s direwolf, <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en>, come to her rescue. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> is badly beaten, and <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> tends to his injuries. Still in grief at <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en>'s death and impressed by <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> defending her, <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> climbs on top of him and they have sex.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
At <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> brings food to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>. She begs him for help, telling him how she has been locked in her bedchamber since her wedding and is visited by <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> every night and he forces himself on her. <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> simply tells her to obey <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> or else he would do worse things to her. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> asks what <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> did to <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> to break him to such an extent, but he can't bring himself to tell her. He tries to leave but <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> grabs and reminds him that he betrayed her family, making <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> apologize profusely. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> informs him that her family still has allies in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> and tells him to light a candle at the top of the <en name='Broken Tower' type='other'>Broken Tower</en> which will signal them that she is in danger. When <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> refuses to do it, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> reminds him of his true name, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en>, and makes him promise that he'll help her. <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> hesitantly agrees. He trudges through the snow with the candle, up a flight of stairs and into <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s room.
Later, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is taken to see <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> on the ramparts, which are still under construction. While he is distracted, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> grabs a workman's tool lying on a nearby barrel and pockets it. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> speaks of his thoughts on how they will easily defeat <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s army since their soldiers, unlike <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s, are trained to fight in the snow, and how he'll one day be the <en name='Lord of Winterfell' type='other'>Lord of Winterfell</en> and the <en name='Warden of the North' type='other'>Warden of the North</en>.
<en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> reminds him of the unborn baby, who, if a boy, will have a stronger claim on the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> since he'll be a true-born. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> tells her that he is <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en>'s eldest son, legitimized by the king, who <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> reminds him is another bastard. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> is obviously angered by <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s remarks, but doesn't act on it, simply stating that bastards can rise in the world too, informing her of <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s appointment as <en name='Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch' type='other'>Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch</en>. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> then brings up the reason why he summoned her, and shows her the crucified and partly flayed corpse of the old woman who promised to help <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> if she lit a candle in the <en name='Broken Tower' type='other'>Broken Tower</en>. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> then reveals to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> that <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>, who seems miserable to have squashed <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s only hope of an escape, came to him and told him everything. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> chokes back tears as a gleeful <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> orders his men to take her back to her chamber. Meanwhile, <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> stares intently at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> castle from her room in the inn, waiting for the sign to rescue <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>.
<en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s troops make camp during a violent snowstorm. <en name='Davos Seaworth' type='other'>Davos Seaworth</en> meets with <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> and informs him that forty horses died the previous night and more will die come sunset. <en name='The Stormcrows' type='other'>The Stormcrows</en>, a sellsword company, have fled in the night. <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> thinks that they should go back to <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> and wait out the weather since they do not have enough food, but <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> stubbornly tells him that they will not retreat to <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> because he will not risk being known as "the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> who <en name='Ran' type='other'>Ran</en>". As winter will soon arrive, they also run the risk of being stuck at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> for years, during which the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en> will regain their strength. Seeing no other way to convince <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> otherwise, <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> leaves.
<en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> asks <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> if she is sure of their victory at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> assures him, reminding him that he also saw the vision of his victory in the flames, but <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is not so sure what he saw anymore. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> reassures him that her visions will come true, but also states that a sacrifice, one with <en name='King' type='other'>King</en>'s blood, must be made in order to ensure their victory, implying that they sacrifice <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en>. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is infuriated by the suggestion and orders her to leave.
In <en name='Dorne' type='place'>Dorne</en>
<en name='Doran Martell' type='person'>Prince Doran</en> has <en name='Areo Hotah' type='other'>Areo Hotah</en> bring <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> to <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> in the quarters where he is confined, as <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is concerned for her safety. Displaying a somewhat more critical mind than her brothers, <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> is suspicious about <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s "diplomatic mission" to bring her back to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, to which <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> only replies that there are "complicated matters" involved. <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> flatly refuses to return with him, stating her intent to marry <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Trystane</en>.
<en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> is singing <en name='The Dornishman 's Wife' type='other'>The Dornishman 's Wife</en> in his jail cell, while in the adjoining cell, the <en name='Sand Snakes' type='other'>Sand Snakes</en> listen with a mix of annoyance from <en name='Obara' type='other'>Obara</en> and <en name='Nymeria' type='other'>Nymeria</en> and amusement from <en name='Tyene' type='other'>Tyene</en>. After he finishes, the two parties trade barbs, and <en name='Tyene' type='other'>Tyene</en> inquires about <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>'s arm, which she cut with her daggers during their earlier fight, with <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> brushing it off as "a new scar". The two begin to talk about <en name='Tyene' type='other'>Tyene</en>'s beauty, which <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> dismisses until she begins to disrobe. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> stares intently, and begins to change his mind about her. <en name='Tyene' type='other'>Tyene</en> once again inquires about his arm, and then his head, at which point <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>'s nose starts bleeding and his vision blurs.
<en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> collapses and tries to play off his sudden illness, but <en name='Tyene' type='other'>Tyene</en> reveals that her daggers were coated with a slow-acting poison called <en name='The Long Farewell' type='other'>The Long Farewell</en>, and her attempts to seduce <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> were to get his heart pumping faster, thereby allowing the poison to act quicker. She points to an ampoule on her necklace, which contains the antidote, but only offers to give it to <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> on the condition that he agrees that she is the most beautiful woman in the world. Growing weaker, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> barely manages to reply affirmatively, and she tosses the ampoule to a relieved <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>. <en name='Tyene' type='other'>Tyene</en> smiles smugly at him and remarks that she finds him handsome as well, before re-robing and sitting down next to her mildly amused half-sisters.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
In the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en>, <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Lady Olenna</en> meets with the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> to discuss the imprisonment of her grandchildren, <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras</en> and <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Queen Margaery</en>. Although they briefly bond over the infirmities of age, she demands that he release them and he declines, stating they will be punished for their crimes. <en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> tells her that the <en name='Gods' type='other'>Gods</en>' Laws must be applied to everyone equally. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> first tries to bribe him, but learning that he cannot be bought, threatens to end the <en name='Tyrell' type='other'>Tyrell</en> support for the capital by ending shipments of food. Again the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> is unfazed, remarking that the nobility of <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> have forgotten they are outnumbered by the common folk and tells <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> to ponder what happens when the many stop fearing the few. Returning to her palanquin, <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> receives a letter bearing <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en>'s seal.
Meanwhile, in the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>King Tommen</en> rails over his inability to help <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>. He wants to start a war for <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, declaring his love for her to a dumbstruck <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>. To maintain control of the situation, she offers to speak with the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> for him and advocate for <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>'s release. Although clearly suspicious, the still-overwhelmed <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> agrees.
<en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> meets with <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> in his ransacked brothel, where they share a tense conversation. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> reminds him of the role they both played in <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s murder, and that, should her <en name='House' type='other'>House</en> fall, she will have no reason to keep his involvement a secret. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> explains why he returned to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> - he dared not refuse <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s summons, and was obliged to give her information. He tells <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> that he will give her the same thing he gave <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>: a handsome young man  -  implied, in this instance, to be <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en>.
In the <en name='Sept' type='other'>Sept</en>'s cells, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> meets with <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and brings her food but <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> refuses, revealing that she knows her mother-in-law is responsible for having her and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> imprisoned. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, fearful of being overheard, denies this. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> mocks <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> for her unconvincing lies of trying to save her, going as far as to say that while she knows how to lie and scheme, she doesn't understand innocence and decency, which <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> suspects is why <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> loves her, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, and was willing to send <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> back to <en name='Casterly Rock' type='place'>Casterly Rock</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, concealing her fury, tells <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> her trial will soon begin and that her son needs his mother more than ever. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> throws the stew at <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, and yells at her to get out. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> leaves the cell, smiling smugly at <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>.
On her way out, a still gleeful <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> meets with the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> in a chapel that predates the <en name='Great Sept' type='other'>Great Sept</en>. The pair briefly discuss the legal process that <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> will face. As the conversation goes on, however, it's clear that the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> is about to turn the tables on <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>. When <en name='Brother Lancel' type='other'>Brother Lancel</en> appears, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> realizes what is about to happen, and her triumphant smile begins to crack. <en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> has an irate <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> taken into custody by a group of <en name='Septas' type='other'>Septas</en> who ignore <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s threats and lock her in a cell.
In <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>
<en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> is sold by <en name='Malko' type='other'>Malko</en> to <en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en> zo <en name='Qaggaz' type='other'>Qaggaz</en>. Before <en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en> leaves, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> convinces him that <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and he are a team, and is also bought. In <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> and <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> discuss her impending marriage to <en name='Hizdahr' type='other'>Hizdahr</en> zo <en name='Loraq' type='other'>Loraq</en>. After rejecting his suggestion that she marry him instead, <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> advises her that, on the day the fighting pits are reopened, she should gather all the <en name='Great' type='other'>Great</en>, <en name='Wise' type='other'>Wise</en> and <en name='Good Masters' type='other'>Good Masters</en> and kill them. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> is reluctant to do so, as she believes it will give her the reputation of a butcher, to which <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> replies that "all rulers are either butchers or meat".
<en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en> takes his fighters to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, to test them in the lower pits and seek out those who are worthy to fight in the <en name='Great Pit of Daznak' type='other'>Great Pit of Daznak</en>. They fight in front of a reluctant <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, as <en name='Hizdahr' type='other'>Hizdahr</en> has convinced her that <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>'s ruler occasionally makes the rounds to the lower pits ahead of the main tournament. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> enters the <en name='Pits' type='other'>Pits</en> early, upon realizing that she is watching and will be repulsed by what she's seeing, and elbows down <en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en> who tried to berate him. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> easily defeats the other fighters without killing them, impressing <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> enough to prevent her from leaving. When he reveals his identity, however, her face swiftly twists into a scowl and she orders him taken away. Before the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> can comply, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> declares that he brought her a gift, and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> enters the arena and reveals his identity to the astonished <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en>.
