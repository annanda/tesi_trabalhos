<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> challenges <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> tells a ghost story. In <en name='Dragonstone' type='place'>Dragonstone</en>, mercy comes from strange quarters. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> waits to see if she is a conqueror or a liberator.
In the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>
At the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en>, the carnage at the <en name='Red Wedding' type='other'>Red Wedding</en> continues to unfold. While the <en name='Northern' type='other'>Northern</en> lords are being slaughtered in the main hall, outside the walls of the castle <en name='House Frey' type='house'>House Frey</en> soldiers ambush the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> army in its own camp. What follows is not a battle but a one-sided massacre as the <en name='Northern' type='other'>Northern</en> army is taken completely by surprise due to the betrayal of their supposed allies. The betrayers torch all of the camp's tents, with many men burning alive inside of them. <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> men wildly mutilate the dead and dying. From one of the twin towers of the <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> stronghold, <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> watches the massacre.
<en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s corpse desecrated, with his direwolf's head sewn in place of his own.
<en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> attempts to slip away amidst the carnage on a horse, along with the unconscious <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en>, by casually riding away while carrying a <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> banner. Before they can leave, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> regains consciousness - as she and the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> turn to see a group of <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> men shouting as they march through the main gate. <en name='The Freys' type='other'>The Freys</en> have horrifically desecrated <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>'s corpse by decapitating it, then crudely attaching the severed head of his direwolf <en name='Grey Wind' type='other'>Grey Wind</en> in its place. Drunk with "victory", the <en name='Freys' type='other'>Freys</en> gleefully parade the mutilated body around the castle on a horse while mockingly chanting "<en name='King' type='other'>King</en> in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>! <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>! Here he comes, the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>!", which is met with by cheers and peals of laughter from the crowds of <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> soldiers.
<en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> is horrified by the gruesome spectacle, while he holds <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, who looks on with a dead stare. <en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> rides away with her, undisturbed thanks to the <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> banner in his hand.
In the great hall of the castle the following morning, as servants clean up the pools of blood left by their former wedding guests, <en name='Lords Walder Frey' type='other'>Lords Walder Frey</en> and <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> gloat over their victory and the rewards their treachery has won them. <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> will become <en name='Lord of Riverrun' type='other'>Lord of Riverrun</en>, and the <en name='Freys' type='other'>Freys</en> will replace the <en name='Tullys' type='other'>Tullys</en> as the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>' vassals in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>. <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> has been appointed as the new <en name='Warden of the North' type='other'>Warden of the North</en>, replacing the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> - though <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> intends to eventually give the position to a future <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> heir produced by <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>.
<en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> expresses his concern that <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden Tully</en> escaped the massacre, but <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> dismisses his worries, pointing out that the <en name='Blackfish' type='other'>Blackfish</en> - and the remaining <en name='Tully' type='other'>Tully</en> garrison at <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en> - is alone and outnumbered against the combined strength of the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>, <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en>, and <en name='Freys' type='other'>Freys</en>, although <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> is still visibly concerned. <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> makes plain his contempt for <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>, considering the late boy-king arrogant, politically incompetent, and unwilling to take <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en>'s advice and make the hard decisions needed to win. <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> questions <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> if he intends to rule the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> from <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, and he says that he might move his ruling seat there at some future time, after it is rebuilt. This leads <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> to ask how <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> ended up a ruin. <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> explains that his bastard son <en name='Ramsay Snow' type='other'>Ramsay Snow</en> offered <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>'s terms that the ironborn occupiers would be shown mercy if they handed over <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en>, but when they did they learned that <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, in his father's words, "has his own way of doing things"...
At the <en name='Dreadfort' type='other'>Dreadfort</en>, <en name='Ramsay Snow' type='other'>Ramsay Snow</en> eats his breakfast of a thick sausage, taunting <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> about his recent emasculation by pointing to his sewn up and blood-stained trousers, and laughing as <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> finally begs for death as a release from the nightmare. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> tells him that he is more valuable alive than dead so the answer must be no. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> notes that <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> reeks, and decides that that shall be his new name: <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> refuses to acknowledge the name, twice insisting that he is <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en>, but after <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> beats him, he finally breaks down and says his name is <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>.
On <en name='Pyke' type='other'>Pyke</en>, <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon Greyjoy</en> reads a message from <en name='Bolton' type='person'>Lord Bolton</en>'s bastard while his daughter <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara Greyjoy</en> cautiously opens a box crudely carved with the <en name='Greyjoy' type='other'>Greyjoy</en> kraken. As <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s letter explains the box contains "<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s favorite toy." The message bluntly says that the ironborn have until the full moon to withdraw from the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> or receive more bits and pieces of <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>. In addition any remaining ironborn will be flayed alive - just as <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> flayed alive <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s twenty ironborn followers at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> after they surrendered, even though he had promised them safe passage. It was in fact <en name='Ramsay Snow' type='other'>Ramsay Snow</en> and his soldiers from <en name='House Bolton' type='house'>House Bolton</en> who burned <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> to the ground: he simply sent false reports for his father <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> to deliver to <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en> which claimed that the ironborn were responsible, as the <en name='Boltons' type='other'>Boltons</en> were preparing to betray the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> months before the <en name='Red Wedding' type='other'>Red Wedding</en>.
<en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> acts indifferent to <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s situation since he defied <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en>'s orders and <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en>'s common sense when he stayed at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. Furthermore, he cannot further the <en name='Greyjoy' type='other'>Greyjoy</en> line as the contents of the box prove. However, <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> does not share her father's attitude toward her last living brother. She announces her intention to take her fastest ship with her fifty best men, sail around <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>, besiege the <en name='Dreadfort' type='other'>Dreadfort</en>, and liberate <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>.
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, a despondent <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> and <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> ride away from the outskirts of the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en>. They pass close to a small group of <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> men, one of whom is bragging about being one of the men who cut off <en name='Grey Wind' type='other'>Grey Wind</en>'s head and attached it to <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>'s body. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> approaches them and sweetly asks to warm herself by the fire. She offers the coin given to her by <en name='Jaqen H'ghar' type='other'>Jaqen H'ghar</en> as payment. When the <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> man investigates, she stabs him in the neck. Slightly thrown, the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> deals with the others before demanding to know where <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> got the knife. She reveals it's his. He admonishes her to let him know the next time she plans to do something like that. As he grumbles and cleans up the bodies, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> whispers, "valar morghulis".
Meanwhile, in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> walk through the gardens. A pair of passing gentlemen snigger at <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, either for his dwarf status or due to rumors he has not consummated his marriage. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> tells him to pay them no mind. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> reminds <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> that he's used to it, as he's always been a dwarf. He also states that he's not <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> would rather bide his time and humiliate them. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> playfully follows his line of thinking, and suggests "sheep-shifting"- secretly hiding sheep's dung deep within a mattress (as <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> used to do to her), so that the target always wakes up smelling of dung. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is amused but is confused by the term, though he realizes belatedly that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> has misheard the word "shit". He is rescued from having to explain his wife's mistake by <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en>, who calls him to a meeting of the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en>.
In <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s chambers <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> dithers over giving <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> a coded message from <en name='Frey' type='person'>Lord Frey</en>. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> jubilantly explains its meaning that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en> are both dead. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is visibly startled by the news, already foreseeing the long-term problems that the incident will cause, but <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> brushes him off and gleefully states that he intends to serve <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s severed head to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> at his wedding feast. None of the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> are able to mask how distasteful they find the concept. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> points out that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s aunt by marriage now (and it would be unseemly not to give her the basic respect that accords).
A deeply embarrassed <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> forces a smile and insists to the rest of the council that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> was only joking and did not mean it. This puzzles <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, who matter-of-factly states to his mother that he did mean it, and he will have <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s head served at his wedding feast. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> flatly forbids it and tells <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> isn't his to torment anymore. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> angrily proclaims that he is the king, and everyone is his to torment. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> counters that a king who has to remind his subjects that he is the king, is no king. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> goes apoplectic and tries to fight his grandfather, deriding <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> as a coward who hid under <en name='Casterly Rock' type='place'>Casterly Rock</en> while <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s father <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> won the real war when he overthrew the <en name='Targaryens' type='other'>Targaryens</en>. The entire <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> tenses waiting for <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> to respond to this shocking insult: instead <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> coldly and calmly declares that the king is tired and advises the <en name='Queen Regent' type='other'>Queen Regent</en> to see him to bed. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> weakly protests that he is not tired but leaves with his mother, and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> also asks <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> to give his grandson a sedative to make sure he goes to sleep.
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> dismisses the rest of the council, save <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, who drily notes that the <en name='Lord of the Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Lord of the Seven Kingdoms</en> has been sent to bed without his supper. He confronts <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> about his part in the <en name='Red Wedding' type='other'>Red Wedding</en>, and deduces that his father must have orchestrated it, as <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder Frey</en> is not brave enough to have carried it out on his own. <en name='The Hand' type='other'>The Hand</en> blithely confirms this. He dismisses <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s concerns that the <en name='Northerners' type='other'>Northerners</en> will never forget nor forgive such an outrage, arguing he wants them to remember so that it will make them wary of rebelling again. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> shows his distaste for <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s choice of a wedding as the place to inflict the slaughter, but <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> responds, asking why killing ten thousand soldiers in battle is nobler than killing a dozen guests at a wedding.
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> again waxes poetic about family, noting <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s failure to consummate his marriage to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> refuses to force himself on <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to do his duty, and notes that she is hardly likely to warm to him now that the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> have murdered her mother and brother. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> demands to know when <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> ever put the family's interests above his own. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> retorts that he did exactly that on the day that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was born: he wanted to throw his newborn son into the sea, but instead he spared him and raised him as his son, because he is a <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en>.
Immediately after leaving, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> returns to his chambers and calls for <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, who simply regards him with a forlorn, tear-streaked face confirming that she was already informed of her family's death. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> backs out, knowing that his sympathy would be rather cold comfort.
Elsewhere in the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> meets with <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>. He tells her that he knows she is genuinely in love with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> - and that is why she should take the diamonds he offers her and leave immediately for <en name='Essos' type='other'>Essos</en> to build a new, lavish life for herself. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> is convinced that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is the last hope for the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>' current regime, therefore <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> is a weakness that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, and thus the realm, cannot afford. <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> confirms that she is in love with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and that she cares deeply for <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> as well, but in spite of her pain at seeing them together and the danger she poses, <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> will not leave until or unless <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> asks her to.
Unknown to everyone in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en>, <en name='Brienne of Tarth' type='other'>Brienne of Tarth</en>, and <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> finally arrive; the city folk do not even recognize <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> after his long absence from the capital. They make their way to the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, where <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> immediately calls on <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, who regards him with a confused look as she takes in his disheveled appearance and missing hand.
At <en name='Dragonstone' type='place'>Dragonstone</en>, <en name='Davos Seaworth' type='person'>Ser Davos Seaworth</en> tests his new-found literacy on <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>'s correspondence, declining <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen Baratheon</en>'s invitation to read more tales of <en name='Aegon I Targaryen' type='other'>Aegon I Targaryen</en>. He expresses dissatisfaction about the odd spelling of the word "night", before hearing the horns that signal <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en>'s intents to sacrifice <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en>. He argues with <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> again about sacrificing the boy, but <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is convinced by <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> that using <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> as part of her blood magic will give him the power to destroy his enemies and claim the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. When he doesn't get through to his liege, <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> takes matters into his own hands and frees the boy, giving him a rowboat and directions to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. A furious <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> sentences <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> to death but the <en name='Onion Knight' type='other'>Onion Knight</en> produces a letter from the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> insists that it is <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en> duty to assist the black brothers, and that he will need <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en>'s assistance to rally troops and mercenaries. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> burns the letter and acknowledges the truth: the <en name='War of the Five Kings' type='other'>War of the Five Kings</en> is irrelevant. The true war lies in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>, and evil and death are marching on the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>. She also agrees that <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> has an important role to play in the events to come. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> sarcastically laughs at <en name='R'hllor' type='other'>R'hllor</en>'s sense of humor, noting that the god <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> likes to mock has chosen him for a higher purpose.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
Arriving at the abandoned <en name='Nightfort' type='other'>Nightfort</en>, <en name='Meera Reed' type='other'>Meera Reed</en> tells <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> and <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> that the castle is safe to enter. While around the fire <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> tells the story of the <en name='Rat Cook' type='other'>Rat Cook</en>, a <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> member who killed a guest under his roof, a sin the gods cannot forgive. Later that night, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> is awoken by a sound, and wakes his companions in time to see something large climbing out of the castle well; <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> attacks and overpowers the intruder, who is revealed to be <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en>, accompanied by <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en>. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> quickly deduces <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s identity by recognizing <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s direwolf and <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> asks <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> to take him and his group north of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, and though <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> protests the idea, given the threat of the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> and the undead horde they command approaching, he eventually relents and takes them through the passage. Before they separate <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> gives the group the rest of his dragonglass supply and tells them that it has the power to kill <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>. The groups then head in different directions; <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> and <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> for <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, and the <en name='Reeds' type='other'>Reeds</en>, <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>, and <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>.
At <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> and <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> meet with <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en>, who is furious at the prospect of <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> having violated his vows. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> defends himself by reciting the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> oath to protect the realms of men whatever side of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> they are on and repeating <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor Mormont</en>'s assertion that a wall of ice 500 miles long and 700 feet high was not built to keep out barbarians. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en>'s demeanor softens upon learning that <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> was one of <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s wives, and acknowledges that she is now a refugee and should be sheltered. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> then orders <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> to begin writing letters immediately and make sure that all forty-four of <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>'s ravens are well-fed, as every one of them is to fly that night: the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> have returned, and <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> must be warned.
Stopping to rest and tend to his injuries after fleeing the wildlings, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> finds himself confronted by a furious <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en>, who has an arrow ready to shoot him. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> tries to talk <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> out of shooting him, insisting that he still loves her but that she should have known his loyalty to the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en> was never gone.
