<en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> presents himself to <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder Frey</en>, and <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> meets his bride. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> faces his harshest test yet. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> discovers a new gift. <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> and <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> debate how to take <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>. <en name='House Frey' type='house'>House Frey</en> joins with <en name='House Tully' type='house'>House Tully</en>.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
Outside the walls of <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> and her commanders plan an attack on the city. Her newest captain, <en name='Daario Naharis' type='other'>Daario Naharis</en>, suggests a plan using a lightly defended back gate, a small group can infiltrate the city and open the main gates for the rest of the army to invade. Though <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah Mormont</en> is skeptical of both the plan and <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en>'s loyalty, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is convinced to try it when she asks <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> if he trusts <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en>. Upon being encouraged to speak his mind, he says he does. <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> also touches her on her hand, flirting for her favor to him. As the captains depart, <en name='Barristan' type='person'>Ser Barristan</en> asks to go along, but <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> reminds him that a <en name='Queensguard' type='other'>Queensguard</en>'s place is at the <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en>'s side, regardless of his pride.
That night <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en>, <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en>, and <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> sneak into the city and fight their way through the slave soldiers guarding <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>. There are far more soldiers than <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> anticipated, much to <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>'s irritation, but it seems that the three are evenly matched - barely.
A few hours later, an impatient <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> paces in her tent, asking <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> how long a sacking of a city usually takes. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> finally enter, covered in dust and gore but grinning widely: <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> is defeated. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is elated, but asks after <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en>, who is still absent. After a suspenseful pause by <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>, <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> strides into the room and kneels before the <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en>. He presents <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>'s torn flag and triumphantly says the city is hers.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='North' type='place'>North</en> of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> and <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> continue their march south, after barely escaping an encounter with a <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> during which <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> actually managed to kill the creature using a dragonglass dagger.
<en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> tells <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> about a way to get through the wall.
<en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> tells <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> that they are a considerable distance west of <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, but this isn't a problem, because this means they are close to the <en name='Nightfort' type='other'>Nightfort</en>, the original headquarters of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, which was abandoned centuries ago as the organization's numbers dwindled. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> explains that he plans to get them across the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> using a secret sally-port which leads right into the <en name='Nightfort' type='other'>Nightfort</en>. <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> is amazed that <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> knows so much history just from reading books, insisting that he is a wizard (much to <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>'s delight) and is awestruck when she finally catches a glimpse of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>.
Meanwhile, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en> and his group have passed far enough north that they have left the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en> proper, and entered into the <en name='Gift' type='other'>Gift</en>: a stretch of land south of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> which was gifted to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> thousands of years ago by <en name='Brandon the Builder' type='other'>Brandon the Builder</en>, from which the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en> draws support for its material needs. <en name='The Reeds' type='other'>The Reeds</en> are puzzled, because the <en name='Gift' type='other'>Gift</en> possesses good arable land but the countryside is empty. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> explains, to <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en>'s discomfort, that wildling attacks coming over or around the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> caused most of the smallfolk to flee the <en name='Gift' type='other'>Gift</en> over the centuries. Meanwhile, the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>'s diminishing numbers mean they don't really need that much support from the <en name='Gift' type='other'>Gift</en> anymore, explaining why they haven't encountered any brothers of the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en> working the lands either. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s group takes shelter in an abandoned mill to get out of a thunderstorm.
Nearby in the <en name='Gift' type='other'>Gift</en>, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> and the wildling party encounter an old man who lives alone at a small farm where he breeds horses for the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. They plan to attack him to steal his horses and gold, but <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> insists that the old man is no threat to them. <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en> and <en name='Tormund Giantsbane' type='other'>Tormund Giantsbane</en> intend to kill the man so as to stop him from alerting the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> to their presence. However, when the party attacks the farmstead, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword, alerting the old man who flees; <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> also distracts <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en>  when she tries to shoot the fleeing man with an arrow. While in the mill, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Jojen Reed' type='other'>Jojen Reed</en> discuss how they plan to cross the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, before <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> spots the old horse breeder riding nearby. After the old man is captured by the wildlings, <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>  -  scared by the thunder  -  begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> uses his warg abilities to enter <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>'s mind and cause him to pass out.
<en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> attacks a <en name='Wildling' type='other'>Wildling</en>.
Outside, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> moves to kill the old man, but <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en> tells him to have <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> do it instead to prove his loyalty. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is ultimately unable to kill the innocent man, and instead <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> kills the man with an arrow. Realizing that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is still loyal to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> orders his men to kill <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>; <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> restrains <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> to stop her trying to help <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, and soon after <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> battles with <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en>. At the urging of <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en>, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> enters the mind of <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en>, his direwolf, to aid <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>. <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> and <en name='Shaggydog' type='other'>Shaggydog</en> kill two wildlings threatening <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> as he battles to the death with <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en> and finally kills him. With the last of his strength <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en> wargs into the mind of his pet eagle, which swoops down and attacks <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, clawing him badly about the face before he beats the bird off. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> then jumps to mount a nearby horse and escapes, leaving <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> and heading back to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>.
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> kills <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en>.
That night <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> asks <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> to take <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> (who would be heir to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> if anything were to happen to <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> or <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>) to <en name='Last Hearth' type='other'>Last Hearth</en>, the home of <en name='House Umber' type='house'>House Umber</en>, while he, <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> and <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> head through the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> in search of the <en name='Three-eyed' type='other'>Three-eyed</en> raven. <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> promises to look after <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> and orders the <en name='Reed' type='other'>Reed</en> siblings to do the same with <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> before she, <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>, and <en name='Shaggydog' type='other'>Shaggydog</en> depart in the dead of night.
At the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en>
<en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>'s army arrives at the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en>, the castle seat of <en name='House Frey' type='house'>House Frey</en>, for his uncle <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en>'s wedding. Enduring <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Lord Walder Frey</en>'s insults directed at him and his wife, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> makes a public apology to <en name='Frey' type='person'>Lord Frey</en>'s daughters and granddaughters for breaking his promise to marry one of them. <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> accepts the apology and offers the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> and their men his hospitality.
That night <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> is introduced to his bride <en name='Roslin Frey' type='person'>Roslin Frey</en>, discovering much to his relief that she is a beauty. The wedding and the feast that follows it are quite celebratory and lively affairs, with all the participants in high spirits.
<en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> and his new bride.
<en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> is clearly in love and his attentions are focused solely on his bride. As the celebrations reach their heights <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Lord Walder</en> calls for the bedding ceremony. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> agrees and the bride and groom are carried off to their wedding bed, <en name='Roslin Frey' type='person'>Roslin</en> carried off by the male guests and followed closely by <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en>, who is collected by the <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> women. <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden Tully</en>, having drunk too much wine, excuses himself from the celebration to "find a tree to piss on."
After they leave and the festivities begin to wind down, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> becomes suspicious when she notices <en name='Black Walder Rivers' type='other'>Black Walder Rivers</en> close the banquet hall doors and the musicians in the gallery begin playing "<en name='The Rains of Castamere' type='other'>The Rains of Castamere</en>"  -  the song commemorating <en name='House Lannister' type='house'>House Lannister</en>'s decisive and brutal victory against the rebellious <en name='House Reyne of Castamere' type='house'>House Reyne of Castamere</en> years ago. <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> rises to make a toast to <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, and <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>, seated beside <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Lord Roose Bolton</en>, notices that the latter is wearing mail under his clothing. Realizing they are in a trap, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> slaps <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> across the face and screams a warning to <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, but by then it is too late. <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Lord Walder</en> signals his men to attack.
<en name='Talisa' type='other'>Talisa</en> is stabbed by <en name='Lame Lothar' type='other'>Lame Lothar</en>.
In what becomes known as the infamous <en name='Red Wedding' type='other'>Red Wedding</en>, <en name='Lothar Frey' type='person'>Lothar</en> draws a knife and repeatedly stabs the pregnant <en name='Talisa' type='other'>Talisa</en> in the stomach, killing her unborn child. <en name='Talisa' type='other'>Talisa</en> collapses to the ground as chaos surrounds. Before he can react, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> is shot by the musicians with crossbows several times and falls to the ground. Numerous other <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> men are killed by the crossbow bolts or set upon by <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> soldiers. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> is shot by one of the musicians in the back and falls to the ground.
Outside, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> and the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>, having arrived at the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en> in disguise, are turned away by <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> guards at the time the massacre begins. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> gives <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> the slip and sneaks past the gate guards, only to witness <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> men kill <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> soldiers and <en name='Grey Wind' type='other'>Grey Wind</en>, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s direwolf. She makes a desperate run for the castle, but is stopped by the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>, who tells her that it is too late. When <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> won't stop, <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> knocks her unconscious before carrying her out of the castle to safety.
<en name='Grey Wind' type='other'>Grey Wind</en> is shot dead by <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> crossbowman.
A wounded <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> crawls to safety beneath a table as <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> motions the soldiers to cease. <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> mocks <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> as he limps to his dying wife. He holds <en name='Talisa' type='other'>Talisa</en> in his arms as she dies. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> sees an opportunity and limps out from under the table to seize out from under <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en>'s table his cowering young wife, <en name='Joyeuse' type='other'>Joyeuse</en>. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> holds a knife to the girl's throat and threatens to kill her if <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> does not negotiate an end to the attack. <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> refuses her, recalling the previous betrayed oath made that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> would marry his daughter. She begs they take her hostage and that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, who merely lingers despondent and heartbroken beside his wife's corpse, be allowed to leave.
<en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> kills <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder Frey</en>'s wife, the <en name='Joyeuse' type='person'>Lady Joyeuse</en>, moments before being killed herself.
He questions why he should agree to such terms to which <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> responds by swearing on her honor as both a <en name='Tully' type='other'>Tully</en> and a <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> that if he does not let <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> go she will kill his wife. <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en> chuckles and nonchalantly responds, "I'll find another." <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> stands and utters, "<en name='Mother' type='other'>Mother</en>" as <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en>, who had fled the hall when the massacre began, seizes <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, whispering "<en name='The Lannisters' type='other'>The Lannisters</en> send their regards," before stabbing him in the heart. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> maintains eye contact with <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> as he collapses to the floor. Mad with grief at the death of her firstborn son, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> cries out in anguish and kills <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en>'s wife, fulfilling her promise. Now catatonic with grief, she stands there and accepts her fate, allowing <en name='Black Walder' type='other'>Black Walder</en> to slip up behind her and viciously cut her throat. She falls to the floor with a thud.
