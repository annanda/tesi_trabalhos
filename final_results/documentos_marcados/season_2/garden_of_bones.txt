A Silent Sister working on a casualty at <en name='Oxcross' type='other'>Oxcross</en>.
<en name='The Northern' type='other'>The Northern</en> army under <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>King Robb Stark</en> leads a surprise night-time assault against an encamped <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> army, which was only manned by <en name='Rennick' type='other'>Rennick</en> and another <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guardsman (<en name='Garden of Bones' type='other'>Garden of Bones</en>), with his direwolf <en name='Grey Wind' type='other'>Grey Wind</en> causing a considerable amount of damage. <en name='The Battle of Oxcross' type='other'>The Battle of Oxcross</en> is a smashing victory, following through on <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s promise to give <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> "another <en name='Whispering Wood' type='other'>Whispering Wood</en>." [2] The next day <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> surveys the battlefield as <en name='Silent Sisters' type='other'>Silent Sisters</en> tend to both <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> and <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> wounded, while his bannerman, <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Lord Roose Bolton</en> of the <en name='Dreadfort' type='other'>Dreadfort</en>, argues that they should kill all of the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> soldiers they took prisoner, because they're having trouble supplying their own army and prisoners will slow them down. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> disagrees, saying they will fight honorably and follow the laws of war. <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> concedes that some of the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> officers might have useful information they could be tortured into revealing, but <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> refuses, not wanting to give the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> an excuse to torture his sisters, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>.
<en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> sees a woman battlefield healer treating a wounded <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> soldier. The prisoner protests when she tells him she has to amputate in order to save his life. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> helps hold him down as she saws off the leg. The woman, who introduces herself as <en name='Talisa of Volantis' type='other'>Talisa of Volantis</en>, criticizes <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> for the need for this war. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> doesn't want the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>, just revenge on <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> for his father's death. She is shocked to learn he doesn't care which king takes the throne after they defeat <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> (having declared for neither of the <en name='Baratheon' type='other'>Baratheon</en> brothers). He just wants them to leave the north alone afterward. She points out that for all the bloodshed they have caused, he hasn't hurt the ones who killed his father, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en>. The men they slaughtered were not <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s main army but unwilling boy soldiers and conscripts from the <en name='Westerlands' type='other'>Westerlands</en>.
The prisoners arrive at <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en>.
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en>, <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en>, and <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en> are taken by <en name='Amory Lorch' type='person'>Ser Amory Lorch</en>'s group of soldiers to <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en>, a vast but partially ruined castle which was badly damaged during the <en name='Targaryen Conquest' type='other'>Targaryen Conquest</en> three hundred years ago by dragons' fire. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>'s group is herded in with many other prisoners the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> soldiers have taken, primarily peasant refugees from the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>. The commander of the entire <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> force is <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor Clegane</en>, "the <en name='Mountain That Rides' type='other'>Mountain That Rides</en>," previously declared an outlaw by <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> for his raiding in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>. Now the positions are reversed, with <en name='Clegane' type='other'>Clegane</en> having the support of the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> to brutalize the <en name='Rivermen' type='other'>Rivermen</en>. The stench of corpses is so strong that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> notices it as soon as they are in sight of the castle. <en name='The Lannister' type='person'>The Lannister</en> soldiers under <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor</en> - particularly one known as <en name='The Tickler' type='other'>The Tickler</en> - sadistically torture many of the prisoners they have taken. One method used is to tie a bucket containing a rat to a man's abdomen, and then to hold a flame to the back of the bucket so the rat will chew its way through the man's guts. The prisoners are for the most part simple peasant refugees with no knowledge of the war, and the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> soldiers are savagely torturing them just because they want to know where they may have hid the few valuables they have. However, some are also asked if they know anything about a group known as "<en name='The Brotherhood' type='other'>The Brotherhood</en>." Just as <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> is about to be tortured, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin Lannister</en> arrives with the main host of his army, who have retreated to <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en> to regroup after their loss at the <en name='Battle of the Whispering Wood' type='other'>Battle of the Whispering Wood</en>. The main <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> army group led by <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin</en> is settling in to use <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en> as their new main base for the ongoing campaign in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>.
"Leave her face, I like her pretty."
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> orders an immediate halt to the tortures (saving <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en>), rationally pointing out how disproportionate it is relative to what little wealth the peasants might be hiding, and it would be far more efficient to put them to work around the castle. As a blacksmith's apprentice, <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en>'s skills are of particular use to them, and he is set to work. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> instantly notices that "<en name='Arry' type='other'>Arry</en>" is really a girl dressed up in boy's clothing, criticizing his soldiers for being too foolish to notice. When he asks her why she's dressed as a boy, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> simply explains that it was safer. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is impressed with her intelligence, and takes her on as his new cupbearer while his army is based at the castle.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey Baratheon</en> is furious when he hears of <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>'s decisive victory against <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> forces. He has <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> brought before the assembled court in the recently redecorated throne room, which now boasts iron spikes on many surfaces and roaring fires surrounding the pillars. <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel Lannister</en> tells <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and the assembled nobles that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> only won the battle with trickery and sorcery. At first, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> sadistically menaces <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> by brandishing a crossbow at her and openly toying with the thought of killing her right in front of the throne to send her brother a message. Despite being clearly terrified, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> refuses to give <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> the satisfaction of scaring her and continues to firmly pledge her loyalty. Annoyed, he reluctantly concedes to his mother's insistence that they need <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> alive, lowering the crossbow and ordering her to stand.
<en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, beaten and stripped in front of the entire court.
<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> then sits down on the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> and commands <en name='Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard' type='person'>Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard</en> to beat and strip her as punishment, but instructs <en name='Trant' type='other'>Trant</en> to leave her face because "I like her pretty." <en name='Meryn' type='person'>Ser Meryn</en> punches <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> violently in the stomach and strikes her in the back of the legs with the flat of his sword, causing her to fall down. He then rips open the back of her gown, leaving her partially naked from the waist up. As the beating continues, the entire court watches in horror, particularly a disgusted <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en>. But despite being filled with dozens of knights and officials, no one intervenes out of fear of <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s wrath.
A furious <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> marches in and puts a stop to the spectacle. He orders someone to cover <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> up and <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> immediately steps forward, taking off his cloak and proceeds to gently wrap it around her. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> turns his wrath upon <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, berating his actions as <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is his future wife and queen that he is publicly shaming (and the fact that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> doesn't pause to think how politically disastrous it would be for their allies to see him having his guards beat a valuable political hostage to a bloody pulp). Furious, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> proclaims that he was punishing her. Denouncing his nephew as a "halfwit," <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> points out the absurdity of punishing <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> for her brother's actions miles away in a war that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> himself started. Now completely enraged, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> bellows that as king, he can do whatever he pleases, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> again coldly counters that the <en name='Mad King' type='other'>Mad King</en> thought he could do as he pleased too, which led to him being overthrown and killed.
<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> torments <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> to send a message to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>.
When <en name='Meryn' type='person'>Ser Meryn</en> tries to support the king, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> silences the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> by ordering <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> to kill <en name='Meryn' type='other'>Meryn</en> if the knight opens his mouth again. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> comforts the shaken <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and personally escorts her out of the hall. He asks her whether she wants to end her engagement to the king, but she continues to parrot the lines that she loves <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and will uphold her duty. <en name='Imp' type='other'>Imp</en>ressed, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> remarks that she has learned how to survive around <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and might just make it out of her situation alive, respectfully calling her "<en name='Stark' type='person'>Lady Stark</en>."
<en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> suggests to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that as an angry young man, maybe what <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> needs is to have sex with a woman, and that they should set him up with a prostitute. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> agrees that maybe this would give <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> a chance to release his frustrations away from <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>. Indeed, he might even be grateful for the gesture: given that he didn't have much of a father figure in <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en> to set him straight, doing something nice for the boy might even be the second chance <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> needs to re-establish a relationship with a male family figure. So <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> arranges for two prostitutes from <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>'s brothel, <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> and <en name='Daisy' type='other'>Daisy</en>, to entertain <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>. Unfortunately, the attempt fails horrifically: instead of trying to have sex with the prostitutes, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> brings a loaded crossbow into the bedchamber. At crossbow-point, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> forces <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> to beat <en name='Daisy' type='other'>Daisy</en> unconscious, and then to dump her body in <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s chambers, to send his uncle a message warning him not to interfere with his handling of <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> again.
As <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> works in his chamber late at night, his cousin <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel Lannister</en> knocks on his door delivering orders from <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> to release <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> from the dungeon at once. Despite their blood relationship <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> clearly holds <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> in contempt and openly calls him "<en name='Imp' type='other'>Imp</en>." Curious, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> asks why <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> is so late delivering the message. Blundering into a rather obvious trap, <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> retorts that he always delivers messages immediately and is never late. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then simply points out how odd it is that <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> would be coming from <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s bedchambers in the middle of the night. <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> nervously says <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> often works tirelessly keeping late hours, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> also notices that he reeks of <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s favorite lavender oil perfume. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> enquires whether <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> was made a knight before or after he started sharing <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s bed. <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> falls apart, saying that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s father ordered him to obey her every command when he became a squire to <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> sarcastically asks if <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> forced him to have sex with her too. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> wonders aloud what <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> would do if he found out that <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> had not only killed <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s father but was also sleeping with his mother. <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> gets down on his knees and pleads for his life. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> gently instructs <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> that he won't tell, but from now on, <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> must report everything <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> does back to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>. As <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> leaves, he also casually agrees that he will accede to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s request and free <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> if she wants him as a "pet", though he doesn't want him back on the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en>.
<en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> "<en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>" <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> arrives at <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>King Renly Baratheon</en>'s camp as a political envoy from <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey Baratheon</en> at <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. He tries to gain <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>'s trust by implying that if <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> does march on the capital, he will help take down the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> from within (it is unclear if he is lying, but he is also ready to jump ship if the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> lose, and <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is not an option, because <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> despises <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>); <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> is tempted by the notion, despite his dislike for <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> then has a conversation with <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Queen Margaery Tyrell</en> in which he tries to intimidate her by hinting that her husband is homosexual. He does not anticipate that <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> seems to already know and not to care. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> is not a naive ingenue like <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> but versed in court strategies: she honestly believes that <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> is the best candidate for king, and voluntarily entered into a paper marriage to secure the political alliance between <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> and <en name='House Tyrell' type='house'>House Tyrell</en>. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> then meets with <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en>, who is still furious at his betrayal of her husband to his death. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> first tries to kindle a romance with her, saying that now they are both free, it may be that they can be together. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> simply draws a dagger and demands that he stop speaking. Discouraged, he moves on to present <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s offer that the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> want to make a prisoner exchange with the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en>: if they release <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en>, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei</en> will release both <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> (<en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> lies about the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> having <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>). <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> insists that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> would never allow the exchange, but <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> tries to manipulate her love for her imprisoned daughters. As a show of good faith from <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> brings forward a pair of <en name='Silent Sisters' type='other'>Silent Sisters</en> carrying a box containing the remains of <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en>. Deeply grieving, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> tells <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> to get out. She looks at the bones with pain, but then shuts the box with a look of resolve on her face.
The shadow wrenches itself free from <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en>'s womb.
<en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>King Stannis Baratheon</en> then arrives at <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>'s camp, along with the <en name='Red Priestess Melisandre' type='other'>Red Priestess Melisandre</en> and <en name='Davos Seaworth' type='person'>Ser Davos Seaworth</en> in his retinue. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> has come to treat with <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> and give him the chance to willingly relinquish his claim and serve his older brother. <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>, along with his <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> members <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras Tyrell</en>, counters that no one wants <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> to be king. <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> also scoffs at <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en> conversion to the religion of the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en>. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en> criticizes both brothers for acting like sulking children. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> counters that it is odd that <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> is standing alongside <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>, given that her own husband <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en> rejected <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>'s initial plan to claim the throne and supported <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> as <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s rightful heir, even at the cost of his own life. In a display of leniency that is uncharacteristic for him, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> offers <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> that if he relinquishes his claim, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> will grant him his old seat on the small council, and even name him as his heir (unless <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> ever has a son in the future). <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> reminds <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> that their common enemy is the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>, but he will not hear it, again asserting his right to the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> states that the 100,000 soldiers waving his banners makes him king, and <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en> small army is hopelessly outnumbered. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> says that they shall see the next morning when their armies clash, and he departs. As she leaves <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> warns, "Look to your sins <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Lord Renly</en>, for the night is dark and full of terrors." <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> watches his brother fade into the distance and asks his companions if they can believe that he loved <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> once.
At <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>King Stannis</en>' command, <en name='Davos' type='person'>Ser Davos</en> rows <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> to some caves located near <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>'s camp. <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> knows these caves from his old smuggling days. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> asks him about whether he desires her, and his views on the conflict they are involved in between right and wrong, insisting that she is on the side of good. They find the way through the caves is blocked by metal bars. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> takes off her cloak revealing that she is naked and heavily pregnant and promptly "gives birth" to a creature made entirely of shadow, as <en name='Davos' type='person'>Ser Davos</en> looks on in horror.
