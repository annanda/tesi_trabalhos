He tries to comfort her through his affections. She refuses initially, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is aggressive. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> insists that the sept during a private viewing of their son's corpse is a highly inappropriate place for sex, and asks <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to stop, saying "It isn't right, it isn't right..." and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> refuses to stop, saying, "I don't care, I don't care...".

He remembers that he still owes <en name='Dontos' type='other'>Dontos</en> his fee, but <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> has two men kill him with crossbows. He explains to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> that <en name='Dontos' type='person'>Ser Dontos</en> was a drunken fool and an unreliable ally who only helped <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> for money and would turn her in for money. To prove his point, he shows that the priceless necklace <en name='Dontos' type='other'>Dontos</en> gave her was actually made a few weeks ago on <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>'s orders. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is confused and horrified, but <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> promises to keep her safe.
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> interrupts <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn Martell</en> and his group sex act with <en name='Ellaria Sand' type='other'>Ellaria Sand</en> and <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar</en> to discuss <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s up-coming trial for the murder of <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> brings up <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en>'s knowledge of poisons and the link between that and <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s death  -  as some say the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> was poisoned  -  and wonders whether <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> had helped <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>. The topic changes to the murder of <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en>'s sister <en name='Elia Martell' type='person'>Elia</en> by <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s "pet," the <en name='Mountain' type='other'>Mountain</en>, during the <en name='Sack of King 's Landing' type='other'>Sack of King 's Landing</en>. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> denies ordering her death, but promises to arrange a meeting between <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> and the <en name='Mountain' type='other'>Mountain</en> so he can have his justice. He also offers <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> a position on the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en>, if <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> agrees to be the third judge at <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s trial. He explains that he is eager to bring <en name='Dorne' type='place'>Dorne</en> back into the fold, wanting to unite the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en> against more obvious threats; the <en name='Greyjoys' type='other'>Greyjoys</en> are in rebellion, a <en name='Wildling' type='other'>Wildling</en> army is advancing on the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, and there is a <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> girl in the <en name='East' type='other'>East</en> with a powerful army and three dragons, who will eventually threaten <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> observes that only the <en name='Dornish' type='other'>Dornish</en> successfully resisted <en name='Aegon Targaryen' type='person'>Aegon Targaryen</en>'s dragons during his invasion of <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> three centuries ago; <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> dryly notes it must be hard for <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> to admit he needs the <en name='Dornish' type='other'>Dornish</en> for help.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is in a cell in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. He is visited by his squire, <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en>, who has smuggled in some food and other items for him. <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> has been asked to compile a list of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s witnesses. He names his wife, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, but <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> informs him that she disappeared moments after <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s death. He cannot speak to <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> either because, as a close associate of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, he is also under investigation. <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> confirms that there has been no word of <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>, which <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> takes as good news. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then asks to speak with <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>. He also warns <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> to be aware of his surroundings and watch out for "They," "They" being the spies of <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> or more or less anyone else. He opines that many people had a motive for killing <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is the only person he rules out. He urges <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> to get out of <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> as he would be in much danger due to his close relations with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, especially after refusing to testify against <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, despite the offer of a knighthood. As <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> is about to leave, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> calls him back and tells him that "there has never lived a more loyal squire."

The farmer believes it and allows the pair to stay the night in his home and share a meal. Famished, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> and the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> scarf the food down hastily. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> wakes the following morning to hear the farmer's daughter screaming. <en name='Clegane' type='other'>Clegane</en> has assaulted the farmer and taken his silver. Confused and horrified, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> demands to know why <en name='Clegane' type='other'>Clegane</en> did that. He simply states, "a dead man doesn't need his silver," claiming the farmer is weak and he and his daughter will not survive the upcoming winter.

Meanwhile, a village south of the wall is attacked by raiding wildlings under <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> and the cannibalistic <en name='Thenns' type='other'>Thenns</en>. While the village is massacred, a lone boy is sent by the <en name='Styr' type='other'>Styr</en> as a messenger to <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> to relay an account of the massacre and also a warning that more would follow. <en name='The Lord Commander' type='other'>The Lord Commander</en> states that they do not have the manpower to afford venturing away from the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>.

As Naharis quickly dispatches the <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> champion, <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> begins her siege of the city by speaking of freedom to the gathered slaves and then catapulting the broken chains of those she has freed across the city walls, demonstrating her previous successes.
