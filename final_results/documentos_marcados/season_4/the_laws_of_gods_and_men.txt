She reads the letter sent by <en name='Ramsay Snow' type='other'>Ramsay Snow</en>, threatening to flay all ironborn who do not leave the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>. While <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> has rather violent sex with <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en>, <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> and her troops land and scale the walls of the castle. They quietly take out the guards as they search for <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>. Interrogating a guard, <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> learns of <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s location which is the dog kennels, and <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> then kills the guard, despite promising not to. There, the ironborn and <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> see <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> sitting in a cage. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> opens the cage, but <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> refuses to go with her, believing it is another cruel trick played by <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> and several <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> troops enter and a fight ensues, with several <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> and <en name='Greyjoy' type='other'>Greyjoy</en> soldiers killed. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> tells <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> his name has always been <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>, bites her, and cowers in his cage. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> releases the hounds and <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> is forced to retreat to her ship. When one of the ironmen asks about <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>, <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> says <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> is "dead."
<en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> allows <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> to take a bath, as a reward for his loyalty. <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> fears the bath is another trick but <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> assures him it is not. While <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> bathes, <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> now plans to assault <en name='Moat Cailin' type='other'>Moat Cailin</en> and needs <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> to pretend to be someone he isn't: <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en>.
At <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
At a meeting of the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en>, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> informs the councilors that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s trial will begin that afternoon. <en name='Varys' type='person'>Lord Varys</en> informs <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> that the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> has been spotted in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> orders a bounty on his head. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> also informs the council of <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s conquest of <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> decides to take measures to prevent her from launching an invasion. In the dungeon, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> has <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> shackled and brought into the throne room to begin his trial. <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>King Tommen</en> recuses himself from the trial, appointing his grandfather <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>, <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Prince Oberyn Martell</en>, and <en name='Mace Tyrell' type='person'>Lord Mace Tyrell</en> as judges.

<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> testifies at <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s trial
At recess, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> asks <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> to spare <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, offering to break his oath to the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> and return to <en name='Casterly Rock' type='place'>Casterly Rock</en>, to be his heir. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> accepts, telling <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> will be allowed to join the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> after being found guilty of <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s murder, provided he pleads for mercy. Before the recess ends, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> speaks with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and urges him to do so. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is deeply distrustful of the offer, remarking that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> was promised the same thing and yet still lost his head, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> pleads with his brother to trust him, insisting that their father will keep his word.
Returning to the trial, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> orders the next witness to testify: <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>. She testifies that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> planned <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s murder together, claiming that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> wanted vengeance for the murder of her father, mother, and brother. She tells the judges of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s sexual desires, embarrassing him in front of the crowd. Before she can continue, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, enraged beyond sense, angrily demands that he be allowed to confess his crimes. He angrily roars about how he saved <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> from <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>'s forces and says he should've allowed <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> to kill everyone in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, much to the horror and disgust of the people in the court. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then claims to be guilty. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> assumes that he is guilty for murdering <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey Baratheon</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> denies this, saying he is guilty of a "far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf!" <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> scoffs at <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s claims and says he is not on trial for being a dwarf. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> angrily says he has been on trial for his entire life as a dwarf. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> asks if he has nothing to say in his defense. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then says he has nothing to say in his defense "but only this." He then reveals his true feelings about <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, denying guilt in the king's murder but saying he wished to have killed <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> himself. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then turns his full fury towards <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and says that watching her "vicious bastard" of a son die gave him more relief than "a thousand lying whores." He then turns around to the court and roars that he wishes to have become the monster they thought he was and would have gladly give his life to watch everyone die from drinking poison. This enrages everyone in the court and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> orders <en name='Meryn' type='person'>Ser Meryn</en> to escort <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> back to the dungeons. Before he can be escorted out, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> bellows that he will not lose his life for a crime he did not commit and, knowing that he will get no justice from the court, demands a trial by combat.

At first <en name='Tycho Nestoris' type='other'>Tycho Nestoris</en>, a representative from the bank, rejects their request, but <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> entreats him and points out that funding <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is the best way they could possibly get the gold they loaned to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> back. <en name='The Bank' type='other'>The Bank</en> agrees to lend them gold, and <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> uses it to once again recruit his old pirate friend <en name='Salladhor Saan' type='other'>Salladhor Saan</en> to <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en> cause.
In <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>
<en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> toasting goats  On one sunny day outside of <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, a goat herder and his son are peacefully tending the goats on a hill while the son throws rocks to pass the time. Suddenly, <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> (now the size of a horse) appears and burns the field and kills a flock of goats while taking one with him. The goat herder travels to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> to visit the queen and lays the charred remains of his flock before <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, hoping to not anger the queen and believes it to be punishment. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> apologizes about <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en>'s actions and promises to pay back three times the worth of his flock.
After he departs, <en name='Hizdahr' type='other'>Hizdahr</en> zo <en name='Loraq' type='other'>Loraq</en> presents his petition: the right to bury his father's remains in the <en name='Temple of the Graces' type='other'>Temple of the Graces</en>, as he was one of the <en name='Meereenese Great Masters' type='other'>Meereenese Great Masters</en> crucified on <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s orders. She counters that he was one of the masters that crucified the 163 children. <en name='Loraq' type='other'>Loraq</en> reveals that his father actually spoke out against the crucifixion of the slave children but was overruled, but later was killed due to <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s judgment anyway. Somewhat mollified, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> allows him to bury his father. As he leaves, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> asks how many more supplicants are waiting; <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> answers that there are over 200 more.
