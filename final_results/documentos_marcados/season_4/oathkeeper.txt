<en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> balances justice and mercy. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> tasks <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> with his honor. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> secures volunteers while <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en>, <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> and <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> stumble on shelter.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> has 163 of the <en name='Great Masters' type='other'>Great Masters</en> crucified.
<en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> teaches <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> how to speak the <en name='Common Tongue' type='other'>Common Tongue</en>, where he reveals that all he remembers since his castration is that he was born in the <en name='Summer Isles' type='other'>Summer Isles</en>. <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> also reveals that she can remember that she saw <en name='Naath' type='other'>Naath</en> burning, as she was tacken as a slave for <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> commands him and several <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> to infiltrate <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> disguised as slaves and convince the slaves to rise against their masters. They visit a slave pen, where a number of slaves are discussing whether or not to rise against the <en name='Great Masters' type='other'>Great Masters</en>. One of the young slaves is already trying to convince his fellow men in chains to fight, but the older slaves argue they have no means to oppose their <en name='Masters' type='other'>Masters</en>, who have squashed every previous slave rebellion. <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> arrives and tells them that only they can free themselves, then presents them with weapons. The uprising is a resounding success. With the city hers, <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> orders the crucifixion of 163 of the so-called "<en name='Great Masters' type='other'>Great Masters</en>" in retaliation for the 163 slave children crucified on the road to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>. Ser <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> advises her against it, saying that sometimes it is best to answer injustice with mercy. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> shows her <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> blood by firmly declaring that she will "answer injustice with justice." The cries of the crucified <en name='Great Masters' type='other'>Great Masters</en> reach <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en>'s ears atop <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>'s tallest pyramid, where the city's emblem, the golden harpy of <en name='Ghis' type='other'>Ghis</en>, has been draped in the banner of <en name='House Targaryen' type='house'>House Targaryen</en>. Now, she has conquered all three of the cities on <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> and <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> are teaching several recruits, including <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> and <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en>, how to fight against wildlings. <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='other'>Alliser Thorne</en> admonishes <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and reminds him that he is a steward, not a ranger, trying to provoke <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> in an excuse to have him killed. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> leaves the yard and talks with <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>, who pretends he is from the <en name='Stormlands' type='other'>Stormlands</en> and genuinely wants to protect the realm. <en name='Janos Slynt' type='other'>Janos Slynt</en> points out to <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is well liked and <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> is not, and when <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> insists upon an election for a new <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en>, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is far more likely to succeed <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en>. <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en> convinces <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> to allow <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to deal with the mutineers, in the hope that they will remove him from the problem. Meanwhile, <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> is fretting about <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en>'s safety in <en name='Mole 's Town' type='other'>Mole 's Town</en> with the wildlings loose, and it is revealed that <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> told <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> about <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> still being alive and north of the wall. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> brings <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en>, who sanctions his mission but tells <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that he must secure volunteers rather than have men ordered along with him. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> gives an impassioned speech, insisting that not only must the mutineers be dealt with for <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>'s safety, but <en name='Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Mormont</en> deserves justice. Much to <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> and <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en>'s surprise, <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en>, <en name='Eddison Tollett' type='other'>Eddison Tollett</en> and a group of other men join <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> on his mission, including <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> who asks to say his vows if that is required before he goes north of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>.
At <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
During their sword training, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> implores <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to visit his brother <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> in the dungeon, saying that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> named <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> his champion in <en name='The Eyrie' type='other'>The Eyrie</en> because he knew <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> would ride day and night to fight for him. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> finally visits <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, confessing that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> asked him to murder him. Convincing <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> that he didn't kill <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>. She is out for <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s blood, and he says that the trial is even worse because at least one judge has always wanted him dead. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> offers a knighthood to whomever captures <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> insists that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> had nothing to do with the murder, despite having the best motive. Later, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> visits <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, who is disgusted that, in her view, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is taking <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s side because of his long-held affection for their brother.
Meanwhile, <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Lady Olenna</en> tells <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> that she is about to leave for <en name='Highgarden' type='other'>Highgarden</en>. She mentions the new and prospective marriage between <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and the new king, <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>. She insists that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> will turn <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> against <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> by the time they marry if <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> doesn't act fast. Fortunately, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is well distracted by accusing her innocent brother of the murder of her son. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> insists that <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> cannot be certain of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s innocence, but <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> states that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> certainly is innocent and confesses that she would never have let <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> marry "that beast." <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> is shocked but her grandmother firmly ends the conversation. That night, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> enters <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>'s chambers, slipping past the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> and charming <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>. She puts in his mind the idea that one day she will be his and they might as well learn to like each other, and compliments him on his cat and kind demeanour. She promises to visit again and <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> falls asleep smiling.
In the chambers of the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> tasks <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> with finding <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>.  He urges her to find and keep the girl safe from those who would hand her over to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and provides her with a horse, supplies, and a freshly forged suit of armor. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> then gifts her with the sword his father gave him, saying that the <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> steel is forged from <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en>'s sword and that the steel from <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en>'s sword should be used to defend <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en>'s daughters. He also insists she take <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en> with her as a squire, both as a reward for the boy's service to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and to keep him safe from those who would seek to use him against his former master. Before departing, <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> names the sword "<en name='Oathkeeper' type='other'>Oathkeeper</en>" and vows to find <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, for the sake of <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Lady Catelyn</en>.
En route to the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>
<en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> accuses <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en> of having <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey Baratheon</en> murdered. At first <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> evades the accusation, pointing out that he has been away for weeks and that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> could be the perpetrator. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> defends <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, with an innate certainty that he is innocent, and mentions that <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> is far too smart to trust a drunk with the scheme. <en name='Imp' type='other'>Imp</en>ressed with her instincts, <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> admits that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is in fact innocent, and reveals <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s own part in <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s death - <en name='Dontos' type='person'>Ser Dontos</en>' necklace was in fact the murder weapon, and someone slipped a stone (which was poisonous) into <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s wine. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is bewildered, because the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> have done so much for <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>, including granting him the seat of <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en>. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> confesses that while his friendship with the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> was fruitful, it is best to keep enemies confused and his absence from the wedding means that he will never be suspected. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> declares that she doesn't entirely believe him: he's too clever to poison a king just to cause confusion. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> is again impressed, and confirms that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> was simply too volatile; a king like him as an ally was more a hindrance than a benefit. More importantly, though, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s death was something that his "new friends" wanted very much, and a gift is always helpful to help a new friendship "grow strong."
<en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>
At <en name='Craster 's Keep' type='place'>Craster 's Keep</en>, the mutinous deserters are still entrenched there, indulging themselves on the food stored there and raping <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s wives. <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> drinks wine from the skull of <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor Mormont</en>, drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> before ordering <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> to "feed the beast." At the same time, one of <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s wives enters with <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s last son, insisting the infant must be given as a 'gift to the gods.. <en name='At Karl' type='other'>At Karl</en>'s orders, <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> leaves the infant on a patch of open ground, then deals with the beast - <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en>, who the mutineers have caged, and whom <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> taunts by withholding food and water from the direwolf. Suddenly, a snowstorm whips up and the temperature drops, causing the water <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> was taunting <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en> with to freeze. Recognizing the approach of <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>, <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> flees.
Nearby, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en> and his companions hear the child's cries; warging into <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en>, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> goes to investigate, but <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> falls into a trap just outside <en name='Craster 's Keep' type='place'>Craster 's Keep</en>. <en name='Meera Reed' type='other'>Meera Reed</en>, sensing danger, urges them to move on, but <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> insists on trying to free <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en> and <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en>; before they can, however, they are taken prisoner by the mutineers. Some of the deserters amuse themselves by tormenting <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>, while the others are taken to <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en>, who threatens to kill <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> and <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en>. <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> is suddenly overcome by a seizure and falls to the floor while <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> begs to be let go so she can help him. <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> does so when <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> reveals his true identity.
In the Lands of Always <en name='Winter' type='other'>Winter</en>
Somewhere in the northernmost reaches of the world, a lone <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> rides its undead horse towards a shattered mountain, cradling <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s last son in its arm. When it reaches the mountain, the <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> places the baby upon an altar of ice at the center of a ring of large icicles. On the other side, a line of dark-garbed <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> watch the proceedings. After a moment, one of them strides forth and carefully picks up the wailing child, who swiftly calms. <en name='The White Walker' type='other'>The White Walker</en> presses the nail of its index finger into the baby's cheek. The sound of cracking ice can be heard as the child's eyes turn a depthless, icy blue.
