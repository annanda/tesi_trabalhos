<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> plot the <en name='Crown' type='other'>Crown</en>'s next move. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> discusses future plans. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> embarks on a new mission.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
In her new headquarters atop the <en name='Great Pyramid' type='other'>Great Pyramid</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> learns that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is dead and <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> has been crwoned. She is irritated to learn that <en name='Daario Naharis' type='other'>Daario Naharis</en> has captured <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>'s navy without her explicit orders to do so, but mulls over the possibility of setting sail for <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> and taking <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> with her 8,000 <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> and 2,000 <en name='Second Sons' type='other'>Second Sons</en>. <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='other'>Barristan Selmy</en> is optimistic about their chances, believing that old <en name='Westerosi' type='other'>Westerosi</en> families will flock to their cause once <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> crosses the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>, swelling their numbers. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah Mormont</en> is less enthusiastic: while 10,000 troops should be enough to take <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> from its exhausted defenders, there's still the rest of the continent to worry about. Her advisors then reveal more troubling news: the <en name='Wise Masters' type='other'>Wise Masters</en> have bounced back and re-enslaved every freed man in <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>, and although <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en> remains free, the council <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> installed has been deposed by a butcher named <en name='Cleon' type='other'>Cleon</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> dismisses everyone but <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and muses that her plans are in shambles. He reminds her that she is the last <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> and the <en name='Mother of Dragons' type='other'>Mother of Dragons</en>, but <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> says she needs to be more than that. She laments that if she cannot keep order in three cities, she has no hope of controlling seven kingdoms. She is therefore resolved to remain in <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> and "do what queens do": rule.
At <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> is crowned king of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>, while <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> makes what appears to be a peaceful gesture towards <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, who remains wary. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> talks to <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Prince Oberyn</en> and asks him a favor. She hasn't seen her daughter, <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en>, in over a year. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> asks <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> to take her a gift, a ship, since she missed her last nameday.
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> reveals to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> their problem with the <en name='Iron Bank of Braavos' type='other'>Iron Bank of Braavos</en>; they owe 'a tremendous sum,' and the gold mines of the <en name='Westerlands' type='other'>Westerlands</en> actually ran dry three years ago. Therefore, even though <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> admits the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> can trust nobody except themselves, they need the <en name='Tyrells' type='other'>Tyrells</en>' wealth and resources on their side. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> suggests coming to some arrangement with one of their representatives, but <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> dismisses the idea, since the <en name='Bank' type='other'>Bank</en> is a monolithic structure that cannot be avoided, lied to or swayed.
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>
While on the road, <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> proves to be a hindrance to <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>. He has problems with his horse and accidentally sets fire to a rabbit they were cooking. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> tries to get rid of <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> by releasing him from the vow he swore as her squire, but to no avail. They are bound for <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, where <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> believes <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> may have taken refuge with her half-brother, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> questions <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> about his duties as squire to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>. He tells her his job was mostly pouring wine, alongside other menial tasks. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> then asks if <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> did anything related to combat. <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> reveals how he killed <en name='Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard' type='person'>Ser Mandon Moore of the Kingsguard</en> by shoving a spear through his head when he tried to kill <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> during the <en name='Battle of the Blackwater' type='place'>Battle of the Blackwater</en>. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> then grants <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> a bit of respect and allows him to help her remove her armor.
In the <en name='Vale of Arryn' type='other'>Vale of Arryn</en>
<en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Lord Petyr Baelish</en> and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> arrive safely at the <en name='Bloody Gate' type='other'>Bloody Gate</en>, though <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> has <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> cover her hair, as auburn is widely known as a <en name='Tully' type='other'>Tully</en> trait, and introduces her as his niece, <en name='Alayne' type='other'>Alayne</en>. Upon arriving at the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en> itself, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> tries to slip into her alias, but <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa Arryn</en> tells her not to bother around her own flesh and blood. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> laments <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s treatment in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, ignoring her attempts to defend <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s character. <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin Arryn</en> is delighted to see <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> and to show <en name='Sansa the Moon Door' type='other'>Sansa the Moon Door</en>. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en>, apparently having finally given <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> some independence, reminds him never to reveal <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s identity and tells him to show her to her chambers. The instant they leave, <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en>, for unclear reasons, insists on marrying <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> immediately, claiming that they already had a wedding night many years ago. She references poisoning her former husband's wine and framing the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> by writing to her sister <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>, using these actions as proof of her love for <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en>. <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> is unable to deter her, particularly when <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> reveals that a <en name='Septon' type='other'>Septon</en> and witnesses have been waiting outside the main door. A delighted <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> declares that she will scream so loudly that night that they will be able to hear her across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>. Later that night, an exasperated <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> attempts to sleep as <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> tries to fulfil that promise.
Later on, <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> has a meal with <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, giving her some lemon cakes. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, relieved to be safe at last, indulges herself, though she becomes a little self-conscious when <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> begins telling stories of <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s overeating in her youth. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> encourages <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to keep eating, as she was only telling a story, and anyway, <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> had three crates of lemons brought from the <en name='Crownlands' type='other'>Crownlands</en> just for <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s cakes. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> suddenly degenerates from a kindly aunt into a psychotic newlywed half-mad with jealousy and demands to know why <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> cares so much about <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, and if he has slept with her as he has his whores. She also rants about <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s love for <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s uncle <en name='Brandon' type='other'>Brandon</en> and how he nearly killed <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en>. Horrified, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> weeps and insists that she is still a virgin and that <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> thinks she's just a stupid girl who doesn't know anything, and who cannot lie at all so always tells the truth. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> immediately calms down and comforts <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, assuring her that she believes her, and that since neither <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> nor <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> had slept with her, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> can proceed to marry <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en>. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> seems unsure of what to make of this information, but one thing is clear: <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> has made her a consummate actress.
On the road to the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>, <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> continue to spar verbally and physically, particularly when <en name='Clegane' type='other'>Clegane</en> disparages <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>'s water dancing and insults <en name='Syrio Forel' type='other'>Syrio Forel</en> for being overcome by a glorified thug like <en name='Meryn Trant' type='other'>Meryn Trant</en>.
<en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>
At <en name='Craster 's Keep' type='place'>Craster 's Keep</en>, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> scouts the keep for the party of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> sent to eliminate the traitors holed up there; in his reconnaissance, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> finds the hut where <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en>, <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en>, <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> and <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> are being held captive. Reporting back to <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> and the others, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> tells them that only 11 traitors are present and most of them are drunk and won't prove much of a threat. He also lies about the hut where the prisoners are being kept, claiming there are hounds kept inside and that they should keep away from it to prevent the dogs alerting their enemy. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> agrees and tells the party they attack at nightfall.
That night, <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> enters the prisoners' hut and attempts to rape <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en>, but <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> distracts <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> when he reveals his possession of greensight and claims to have seen <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> dead before the night is out. At that moment, <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> rushes in to warn <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> the keep is under attack; <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s party rushes through the defenses and starts killing their traitorous former brethren. In the confusion, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> slips into the tent and attempts to abduct <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, but <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> wargs into <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> and uses him to kill <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> spots <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> in the fighting, but <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> prevents him from going to his older brother, reminding <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> that they must continue onward to reach the three-eyed raven and that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> would stop them. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> reluctantly leaves despite being so close to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>.
<en name='The Night 's Watch' type='other'>The Night 's Watch</en> swiftly overcome their enemy and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> confronts <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> in single combat. <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en>'s use of dirty tactics learned in his criminal past give him the upper hand. Before he can finish <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, one of <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s wives, <en name='Sissy' type='other'>Sissy</en>, stabs him from behind. When <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> rounds on her, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> gets back to his feet and drives <en name='Longclaw' type='other'>Longclaw</en> through the back of <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en>'s skull, killing him.
In the aftermath of the battle, four brothers of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, including <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>, are found to have died, while all the traitors but one are accounted for. The sole survivor, <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en>, runs in terror through the forest until he reaches the cage where <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en> was held. He notices someone has opened the cage but before he can do more than absorb this fact, the direwolf lunges out of nowhere and kills him. <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en> then finds his way back to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, who is overjoyed to see his companion again. Speaking to <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s wives, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> warns them that <en name='Mance Rayder' type='other'>Mance Rayder</en>'s army and worse besides will soon reach their location and offers to take them to safety south of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, but the women refuse, preferring to set out on their own. Before departing back for <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> has <en name='Craster 's Keep' type='place'>Craster 's Keep</en> burned to the ground, along with the bodies of all those who died there.
