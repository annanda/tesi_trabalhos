<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> welcomes a guest to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. At <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> finds himself unwelcome. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> is pointed to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, the mother of all slave cities. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> runs into an old friend.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> has the ancestral <en name='Stark Valyrian' type='other'>Stark Valyrian</en> steel greatsword <en name='Ice' type='other'>Ice</en> (held by the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> since <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en>'s execution) melted down and re-forged into two smaller swords, after which he burns the wolf pelt scabbard the greatsword was held in. He presents one to his son <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> as a gift. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is impressed, as the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> have never previously owned a <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> steel sword. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> tells him he acquired the original sword from "someone who no longer needed it" and then commissioned a <en name='Volantis' type='other'>Volantis</en> blacksmith to re-forge it. He wants <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to be his heir and return home to <en name='Casterly Rock' type='place'>Casterly Rock</en>, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> insists on remaining in the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en>. Furious at <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s disobedience and lack of ambition, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> rebuffs him. He tells <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to keep the sword anyway.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en>, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>, and <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en> wait on a road outside the city for the arrival of <en name='Doran Martell of Dorne' type='person'>Prince Doran Martell of Dorne</en>, who has been invited to the royal wedding. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> quizzes <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> on the sigils of the <en name='Dornish' type='other'>Dornish</en> houses, none of which he knows, however <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> answers perfectly. <en name='Lord' type='other'>Lord</en> Blackmont approaches them on horseback and says <en name='Doran Martell' type='person'>Prince Doran</en> is in poor health and remained at <en name='Sunspear' type='other'>Sunspear</en>. <en name='Doran Martell' type='person'>Doran</en>'s brother, <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Prince Oberyn</en>, will be attending the wedding in his stead, and arrived before dawn. Assigning the reception of the <en name='Dornish' type='other'>Dornish</en> <en name='Lords' type='other'>Lords</en> to the <en name='City Watch' type='other'>City Watch</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says they should find <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> as soon as possible "before he kills somebody or several somebodies".
<en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Prince Oberyn</en> and his bastard paramour <en name='Ellaria Sand' type='other'>Ellaria Sand</en> are examining prostitutes in a brothel owned by <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en>, but currently managed by <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar</en>, as <en name='Baelish' type='person'>Lord Baelish</en> is now in the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>. They choose the contortionist <en name='Marei' type='other'>Marei</en>, and <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> orders <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar</en> to get undressed also. <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> is infuriated when he hears men singing The Rains of Castamere. He confronts the two <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> soldiers, who insult him and <en name='Ellaria' type='other'>Ellaria</en>. <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> moves closer and chastises them for being "pink little men who are far too slow on the draw" rather than being "golden lions". One of the soldiers reaches for his sword, and <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> quickly stabs him through the wrist with a dagger and tells the other that his friend will only live if he immediately gets help. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> enter, and <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> step outside to speak privately. <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> says he wants revenge for the murder of his niece <en name='Rhaenys' type='other'>Rhaenys</en>, his nephew <en name='Aegon Targaryen' type='person'>Aegon</en>, and the rape and murder of his sister <en name='Elia Martell' type='person'>Elia</en> in the sack of <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> by <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> troops during <en name='Robert 's Rebellion' type='other'>Robert 's Rebellion</en>. He wants <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor Clegane</en>, who murdered <en name='Elia Martell' type='person'>Elia</en>, and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>, whom <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> believes gave the order for <en name='Elia Martell' type='person'>Elia</en> and her children to be killed.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>, and another handmaiden are sitting in a garden. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is still distraught over the deaths of her brother and mother. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> attempts to console his wife but fails; <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> has heard the gruesome details of the <en name='Red Wedding' type='other'>Red Wedding</en>, how the corpses of her mother and brother were desecrated. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> then leaves for the godswood, not to pray but because it is the only place no one talks to her. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> returns and finds <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> in his bed. He scolds her because no one can find out about their relationship. She attempts to seduce him but he resists. She accuses him of trying to bribe her with diamonds and ship her away to the <en name='Free Cities' type='place'>Free Cities</en>, but he doesn't know what she's talking about (<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> did this acting alone). She angrily leaves the room but is spotted by the handmaiden, who is hiding behind a pillar.
<en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, and <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> are in <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s chambers. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> has had a golden prosthetic hand made for <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, and <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> attaches it to <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s stump. <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> asks <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> about her symptoms, and she says they are gone. After <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> departs, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> tells her that he will stay in the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> with one hand so he can stay close to her, then tries to kiss her, but she turns away, much to <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s confusion and anger. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> implies that she has taken other lovers and that their relationship has changed because of his lengthy absence, a statement that clearly wounds <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>. The handmaiden suddenly enters and says she has important information for <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>.
As preparations for the royal wedding continue, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery Tyrell</en> and her grandmother <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> are interrupted by <en name='Brienne of Tarth' type='other'>Brienne of Tarth</en>, (<en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> being delighted to see the truth of the rumors about <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>) who requests a private word with <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> tells <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> the truth of <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>'s death and vows to one day exact revenge on <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>, whom she holds responsible. They walk past a statue of <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en> standing over a dead direwolf, commemorating the victory over the northern rebellion.
Elsewhere in the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, <en name='Meryn Trant' type='person'>Ser Meryn Trant</en> and <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en> discuss security at the upcoming wedding. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is clearly irked by <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s arrogance as well as <en name='Meryn' type='other'>Meryn</en>'s sycophantic agreement with the king's bragging that he is responsible for keeping the people fed (<en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> notes that this is more the doing of the <en name='Tyrells' type='other'>Tyrells</en>) and claiming he singlehandedly won the war. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> (who had previously noted to his father that thousands in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> alone still want <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> dead) points out that the war is far from won; <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is still alive and will probably raise fresh armies. Dismissive of the threat posed by <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> following the <en name='Battle of the Blackwater' type='place'>Battle of the Blackwater</en>, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> leafs through the <en name='Book of Brothers' type='other'>Book of Brothers</en>, which details the history of the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> and those who served in it. He reads <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s brief entry and sneers that someone must have forgotten to record all of his uncle's great deeds. He also questions <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s ability to serve in the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> with one hand. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> defensively quips that using his left hand makes for more of a challenge.
As <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> prays alone in the godswood, she is watched by <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>; <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> expects <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to uphold his oath to return <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en>'s daughters in return for his freedom, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> counters by pointing out the situation is complicated by <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s death and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s marriage to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>. As <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is leaving the godswood, she is approached by <en name='Dontos Hollard' type='other'>Dontos Hollard</en>, who thanks her for convincing <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> to spare his life and gives her what he claims to be his mother's necklace as a token of gratitude.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
<en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> and <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> stand outside a stone ravine. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> chides her for failing to finish off <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>. Suddenly, their scouts signal that someone is approaching. <en name='Styr' type='other'>Styr</en> and a band of <en name='Thenn' type='other'>Thenn</en> approach them through the ravine. Out of earshot, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> comments about how much he hates <en name='Thenns' type='other'>Thenns</en>. <en name='Styr' type='other'>Styr</en> says his party raided a village south of the ravine and gathered meat. He says the meat tastes so much better south of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, and chides <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> for losing their warg as well as <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>. He reminds <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> how the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> are feasting and getting fat at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>. <en name='Styr' type='other'>Styr</en> suggests that <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> taste crow meat before he dies, as a human arm roasts over a fire.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
At <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> has survived the injuries inflicted by <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> and has largely recovered, though he still grimaces while getting dressed and walks with a slight limp. Having been told of <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s death, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> shares with <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> that he had always been jealous of <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> for having more of their father's affection and for being better than him at riding and fighting, and with girls. Despite all this, he says he could never bring himself to hate <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> responds by saying he has felt the same way about <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is better than him at everything (except reading).
It turns out that <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> had been sent to retrieve <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers, including <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en>, acting <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Lord Commander Alliser Thorne</en>, <en name='First Builder Othell Yarwyck' type='other'>First Builder Othell Yarwyck</en>, and the exiled former <en name='Lord Commander of the King 's Landing City Watch' type='other'>Lord Commander of the King 's Landing City Watch</en>, <en name='Janos Slynt' type='other'>Janos Slynt</en>. Both <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> and <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en> are openly hostile to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, disbelieving much of what he says. At the hearing, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> admits to killing <en name='Qhorin Halfhand' type='other'>Qhorin Halfhand</en> but says that it was not murder, rather <en name='Qhorin' type='other'>Qhorin</en> wanted <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to kill him to give <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> credibility with the wildlings in order to get a spy into <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>'s army. <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en> dismisses <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> as "the bastard son of a traitor" while <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en>, a friend of <en name='Qhorin' type='other'>Qhorin</en>'s, reacts with incredulity that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> would presume to act like he knew the <en name='Halfhand' type='other'>Halfhand</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> responds by saying that <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> should know that <en name='Qhorin' type='other'>Qhorin</en> would have done anything to protect the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>.
When <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> refers to the wildlings as "<en name='Free Folk' type='other'>Free Folk</en>," <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en> accuses him of going native, to the extent he even talks like them. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> snaps back, acknowledging that he talks like a wildling and also admits to living amongst the wildlings, eating with them, and climbing the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> with them. He catches himself before admitting that he lay with one, but says it anyway. <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en> calls for <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s execution for breaking one of his vows. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> points out the impracticality of executing every ranger who lays with a girl and says that "the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> would be manned by headless men." <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> says that there is a difference between sneaking off to a brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> does not defend himself at this point. Instead, he says that <en name='Mance Rayder' type='other'>Mance Rayder</en> intends to attack the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> with his army of 100,000 wildlings and gives intelligence on <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>'s plan of attack. Both <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> and <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en> disbelieve what <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> has to say. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en>, however, realizes that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is speaking the truth, and the hearing ends with <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> being allowed to keep his head, although after <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> leaves, <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> expresses his distrust for <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>.
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> and the "<en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>" <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> are still traveling through the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en> on a single horse. They pass by overturned carts and dead bodies, including those of children. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> asks when she is going to get her own horse, complaining of the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>'s stench. He scoffs at the idea, noting that horses are hard to come by and that he wouldn't give <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> her own horse (even if one was available) as she is the only thing of value he has since he did not take anything of value when he left <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> assures him she has no plans to run off, saying that she would die by nightfall without him as she has no one to go to. <en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> reminds her that she still has an aunt in the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>, <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa Arryn</en>, to whom he plans to ransom <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>.
The two eventually come upon a tavern. Both hungry, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> suggests that they attack the men there, to which the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> expresses reluctance as there are five men. Just then, two men exit to relieve themselves. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> recognizes one of them as <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en>, the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> man-at-arms who had previously taken <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>'s sword <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en> and killed her friend <en name='Lommy' type='other'>Lommy</en>. She also notices that <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> still has <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en> and runs off to get it back. <en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> chases after her, stopping her at the tavern's door, but they are seen and choose to go in anyways.
It is clear that <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> and the other men are making trouble and intend to rape the tavern owner's daughter. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> and the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> go to a table far away from everyone else, but <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> still recognizes the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> and walks over to their table and strikes up a conversation. He does not recognize <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, who he thinks is just the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>'s latest sexual conquest. <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> implies that he and his men intend to rape and pillage on their way back to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and invites the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> to come along. <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> says that he and his men wear the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en>'s colors and can do whatever they like, to which the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> leans forward and states emphatically, "<en name='Fuck the King' type='other'>Fuck the King</en>."
The conversation then becomes tense and turns into a standoff. They eventually draw their swords. At first, the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> fights the five men alone while <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> stands in the corner. He easily dispatches two of them and fights off the rest, stabbing one in the groin. Another, however, gets him on the ground, holding a dagger to his throat. <en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> is able to fight him off, stabbing him repeatedly in the head with his own dagger.
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> then joins the fray, smashing a pot over the head of one of the men and stabbing him with his own long sword. She then slashes <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en>'s leg from behind, causing him to fall to the ground. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> takes <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en> from <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> and stands over his prone form. She echoes what he had said to <en name='Lommy' type='other'>Lommy</en> just before he killed him, though <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> still doesn't recognize her and has no idea what she is talking about. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> then repeats what he had said to her when he took <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en>: "<en name='Fine' type='other'>Fine</en> little blade. Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it." It is at that point when <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> recognizes her and becomes frightened. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> then kills <en name='Polliver' type='other'>Polliver</en> in the same way he had killed <en name='Lommy' type='other'>Lommy</en> by driving <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en> slowly into his throat. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> and the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> then leave the tavern, taking with them a horse for <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> and a chicken the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> wanted.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> sits near the sea with her three dragons, each one about the size of a small horse. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> strokes <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en>'s head, while <en name='Rhaegal' type='other'>Rhaegal</en> and <en name='Viserion' type='other'>Viserion</en> fight over a dead lamb, <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> joins the fight. As <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> tries to calm him down, without warning, <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> snaps at her with a hiss, a warning to not interfere. He then roars and goes to contest the kill.
<en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> snarls a warning at his mother.
This act, that her own children would threaten her, and that they are outgrowing her influence and ability to rein them, leaves <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> visibly shaken. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah Mormont</en> approaches and tells her that dragons can never be tamed, not even by their mother.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> returns to her <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> army to resume the march to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>. She notices <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> and <en name='Daario Naharis' type='other'>Daario Naharis</en> are absent and sets out to find them after being told they are "gambling". She finds the two men sitting face-to-face holding their swords in front of them; they have been contesting their strength since midnight. <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> explains they are deciding on which of them will ride up front with her in the vanguard. Frustrated, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> states that the honor goes to Ser <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and Ser <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> as they did not keep her waiting all morning. She orders the two men to ride at the back with the livestock. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> also adds that the last man holding his sword shall find a new queen to fight for and both men immediately drop their weapons.
