At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
As <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> awakens and gasps for air, he slowly sits up and scans the room. He then looks down and is horrified by his stab wounds. <en name='Davos Seaworth' type='other'>Davos Seaworth</en>, having returned to the room, is shocked but relieved and quickly helps <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> as he struggles to walk. <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> asks <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> if he remembers anything. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, still shocked, says yes, he remembers getting stabbed by <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en> and <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='other'>Alliser Thorne</en> for bringing the <en name='Wildlings' type='other'>Wildlings</en> to <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> enters, shocked that the resurrection has worked. She then goes to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and asks him where he was after his death. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> replies he saw nothing, much to <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en>'s disappointment. Seizing on whatever hope she still has, however, she says that the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> brought <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> back for a reason; that <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> was not <en name='The Prince That Was Promised' type='other'>The Prince That Was Promised</en>, but "someone must be." <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> asks <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> to leave them alone so <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> can adjust to his revival.
After he has recovered somewhat, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> dons his <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> armor and the <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en>'s cape, and walks into the courtyard, seeing many of the fellow <en name='Brothers' type='other'>Brothers</en> arrive before him. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, still struggling to walk properly, comes down and greets the dumbfounded <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en>. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> jokes with the resurrected <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en> before hugging him tightly which slightly pains <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> due to his stab wounds. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> then greets the relieved <en name='Eddison Tollett' type='other'>Eddison Tollett</en> and they embrace.

He then says that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> bringing the <en name='Wildlings' type='other'>Wildlings</en> was a dangerous problem and had to be stopped, and warns him that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> will be fighting their battles forever.
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> then moves on to <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en>, who says nothing and glares furiously at <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> reluctantly cuts down the rope, killing all four traitors. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> looks at <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en>'s lifeless body.

While <en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en> had originally planned to go and study at the <en name='Citadel' type='other'>Citadel</en>, he changes his plans since he cannot bring <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> and her child along as the <en name='Citadel' type='other'>Citadel</en> only allows men within its walls.
Unwilling to abandon <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> and <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> to the streets, <en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en> decides to take them to his ancestral home of <en name='Horn Hill' type='other'>Horn Hill</en>.

<en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>
<en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> has a vision of the past again. He and the three-eyed raven are at the <en name='Tower of Joy' type='other'>Tower of Joy</en> in <en name='Dorne' type='place'>Dorne</en>, shortly after the end of <en name='Robert 's Rebellion' type='other'>Robert 's Rebellion</en>. The last two of the <en name='Targaryen Kingsguard' type='other'>Targaryen Kingsguard</en> stand before the <en name='Tower' type='other'>Tower</en> and block the way of a small party of <en name='Northmen' type='other'>Northmen</en> led by <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> himself. The three-eyed raven identified one of <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s companions as <en name='Howland Reed' type='other'>Howland Reed</en>, <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en>'s father. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> tells <en name='Arthur Dayne' type='person'>Ser Arthur Dayne</en> and <en name='Gerold Hightower' type='person'>Lord Commander Gerold Hightower</en> to stand down, and asks why they weren't at the <en name='Trident' type='other'>Trident</en>. <en name='Arthur' type='person'>Ser Arthur</en> states that <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> ordered them here to guard the tower, so there they remained, even as <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> and <en name='Aerys Targaryen' type='person'>Aerys</en> both died. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> asks where his sister <en name='Lyanna Mormont' type='person'>Lyanna</en> is, but <en name='Dayne' type='other'>Dayne</en> simply wishes <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> the best in the wars to come. The two <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> draw their swords, with <en name='Arthur' type='person'>Ser Arthur</en> saying, "And now it begins," to which <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> replies "now it ends." The two sides clash, with <en name='Dayne' type='other'>Dayne</en> making short work of a few of <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s northmen. <en name='Arthur' type='person'>Ser Arthur</en> slowly cuts down the number of northmen, but <en name='Gerold' type='person'>Ser Gerold</en> falls to <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s blade. Eventually, <en name='Arthur' type='person'>Ser Arthur</en> duels <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> one-on-one. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> expresses his shock at <en name='Arthur' type='person'>Ser Arthur</en>'s skills, with the three-eyed raven confirming that the <en name='Sword of the Morning' type='other'>Sword of the Morning</en> is better than <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>. <en name='Dayne' type='other'>Dayne</en> easily gains the upper hand and kicks <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s sword away from him, but is unprepared for <en name='Howland' type='other'>Howland</en> stabbing him through the back of the neck. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> seems visibly uncomfortable at winning this way, but unhesitatingly delivers the killing blow to the incapacitated <en name='Arthur' type='person'>Ser Arthur</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> is shocked, as he had heard tales of this duel and never expected his father to stand for such things.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> runs towards the tower, having heard a woman's scream come from one of its windows towards the end of the duel. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> runs to follow <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>, calling out, but he is told it's time to go by the raven. <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en> looks back for a second, seemingly hearing <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, but then runs into the <en name='Tower' type='other'>Tower</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> tries to follow, but he is forced out of the past and back into the cave by the three-eyed raven, saying he had stayed in the past for too long. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> is both angry and sad at this, but the raven asserts it was for his safety, and again sternly reminds him that the past cannot be changed. The raven further states that he's waited a thousand years for <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> to arrive, and that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> will not share the raven's destiny. But before he can leave the cave, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> must learn everything.

Shortly afterwards, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en> and the reanimated <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor Clegane</en> enter. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> wants <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> to gather information from <en name='Dorne' type='place'>Dorne</en>, <en name='Highgarden' type='other'>Highgarden</en>, the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> and wherever people are trying to take advantage of their losses and plotting against them.
At the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> meeting, <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> complains about <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> and his experiments. <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Ser Kevan Lannister</en>, now <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en> - is heading the <en name='Council' type='other'>Council</en>  -  which now consists of himself, <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en>, and <en name='Mace Tyrell' type='person'>Lord Mace Tyrell</en>  -  with <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Lady Olenna Tyrell</en> in attendance to lobby for <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras Tyrell</en>'s release. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor</en> enter the room, startling <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> and <en name='Mace Tyrell' type='person'>Mace</en>. On being questioned about what they are doing at a small council meeting, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> replies that she is the <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en>, only to be corrected by <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> that the rightful queen is the one married to the king and that <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> is the one who fits that description. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> then argues that he, as <en name='Lord Commander of the Kingsguard' type='other'>Lord Commander of the Kingsguard</en>, also has a right to attend. <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> admits that <en name='Gerold Hightower' type='person'>Ser Gerold Hightower</en> once sat on the council, but dismisses this due to the <en name='Mad King' type='other'>Mad King</en>'s eccentricities. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> accuses <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en> of not caring for her daughter <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en>, while <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> appeals to the bigger picture and urges <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en> to take action against <en name='Ellaria Sand' type='other'>Ellaria Sand</en> and the <en name='Sand Snakes' type='other'>Sand Snakes</en> who have taken over <en name='Dorne' type='place'>Dorne</en> after eliminating <en name='House Martell' type='house'>House Martell</en>.

Despite their differences, the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> claims admiration for the deep love that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> has for her son, <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>, which he attributes to the divine love of the <en name='Mother' type='other'>Mother</en>.
When <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> asks the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> why he wants to put his mother through more trials, the <en name='Sparrow' type='other'>Sparrow</en> replies that he is merely carrying out the will of the <en name='Seven' type='other'>Seven</en>. He urges the young <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> to turn to the <en name='Seven' type='other'>Seven</en> for wisdom. Before <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> leaves, less angry and more uncertain, the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> tells him that the <en name='Seven' type='other'>Seven</en> have worked through his grandfather and mother even though they may not acknowledge it.

She became a prostitute out of patriotic fervor for the old ways. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> assures <en name='Vala' type='other'>Vala</en> he has no interest in torturing her and decides to strike a deal. In return for revealing who is funding the <en name='Sons of the Harpy' type='other'>Sons of the Harpy</en>, he offers her and her son safe passage on a ship bound for <en name='Pentos' type='place'>Pentos</en> with a bag of silver to start a new life. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> warns her that if she doesn't agree to the offer, she will be executed for her crimes, leaving her son orphaned.

While <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> advocates attacking the cities, <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> advises against it since that would leave <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> unprotected. Using this information, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> asks <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> to use his little birds to send them a message.

Upon entering the temple, the <en name='High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen' type='other'>High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen</en> orders the bloodriders to leave and strips her naked, giving her a robe which the dosh khaleen wear. As <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> puts on her new clothes, she tells the high priestess that she will soon regret what she has done as she was the wife of a great khal the <en name='Queen of Meereen' type='other'>Queen of Meereen</en>, and the <en name='Mother of Dragons' type='other'>Mother of Dragons</en>. The high priestess retorts that she herself was the wife of a previous <en name='Great Khal' type='other'>Great Khal</en>, <en name='Savo' type='other'>Savo</en>. Just as <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> thought she would conquer the world at <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s side, so did the high priestess think she would conquer the world at <en name='Savo' type='other'>Savo</en>'s. But <en name='Savo' type='other'>Savo</en> was slain, and she joined the dosh khaleen. She is now content, just as <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> would be if she is allowed to join them. When <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> expressed confusion, the priestess points out that khaleesi are supposed to return to <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en> immediately after their khal's death... but <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> went out into the world. She explains that all the khalasars have gathered to decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved, and now they will have to decide what to do with <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> for not coming to the dosh khaleen after <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> died.

When <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> insists that she is no one, the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en> does not believe her and tries to hit her. However, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is able to deflect her blow and leap out of the way, surprising the <en name='Waif' type='other'>Waif</en>. After confirming that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> has mastered blind sparring, <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> approaches <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> and offers to give back her sight if she tells him her name. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> replies that "a girl has no name." <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> then leads <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> to the well where he scoops up a bowl of water, which he offers her. She is reluctant, as others have drunk from it and died, but he says that if she is truly "no one" there is nothing to fear. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> drinks from the bowl and her sight is restored. When <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> asks <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> who she is, she replies that she is no one.

The first turns out to be <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en>  -  the second is <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon Stark</en>, <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en>'s youngest child. <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> appear uncomfortable to find themselves in <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s presence. When <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> asks <en name='Smalljon Umber' type='person'>Smalljon</en> to verify <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>'s identity, an <en name='Umber' type='other'>Umber</en> retainer enters the room carrying the severed head of the direwolf <en name='Shaggydog' type='other'>Shaggydog</en>, and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>'s expression of dismay confirms this was his pet. Satisfied, a gleeful <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> then issues a sarcastic "welcome home <en name='Stark' type='person'>Lord Stark</en>."
