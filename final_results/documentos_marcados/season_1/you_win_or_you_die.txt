<en name='The Lannister' type='person'>The Lannister</en> army, poised to invade the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en>'s investigations in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> reach a dramatic climax as he confronts <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei</en> with his findings. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> prepares his forces for battle and gives <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> an important assignment. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en>'s actions inspire <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> to make an important vow. <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> finally takes his place amongst the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>.
At the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> Camp
On the borders of the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin Lannister</en> has assembled an army of sixty thousand men, with which he plans to oppose the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> and punish <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s capture of his son <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en>.
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> discusses the future of <en name='House Lannister' type='house'>House Lannister</en> with his son <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>.
As he stands in his tent skinning a dead stag, he tells his elder son, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, that this conflict will decide the fate of their family; they will either forge a dynasty that will last a thousand years or cease to exist, as the <en name='Targaryens' type='other'>Targaryens</en> had done. He orders <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to become the man he was meant to be, and to take thirty thousand men and besiege <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en>, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s childhood home and the seat of <en name='House Tully' type='house'>House Tully</en>. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> ponders why <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> would risk so much for the ugly, stunted son that he hates, but to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> a <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> is a <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> - even though he considers <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> the least worthy member of their family, any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> attempts to intimidate <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en>.
In <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> attempts to bully <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en>, the wildling woman captured in the recent raid. He insists that she refer to him as "<en name='My Lord' type='other'>My Lord</en>", but she is unimpressed with his antics. She points out that he is not entitled to this, as his father is still alive. <en name='Luwin' type='person'>Maester Luwin</en> dismisses <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> and questions <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> about why her band crossed the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and were fleeing "as far south as south goes". She claims that the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> have awoken after a millennia asleep and are coming south, to <en name='Luwin' type='other'>Luwin</en>'s skepticism.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> and <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> are standing watch atop the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> when <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen</en>'s horse is spotted returning, but, to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s horror, there is no sign of <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen</en> himself.
Later on, <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</en> names the trainees as men of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. He hands out assignments, but to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s disgust he is being sent to the stewards, not the rangers. He will work directly for the <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en> as his personal steward. His attempts to plead his case to <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> (who has selected <en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en> as his own steward) are met with indifference. However, <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> suggests to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that while this move was possibly orchestrated by <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Ser Alliser Thorne</en> to punish <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, it is also an opportunity for the <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en> to groom <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> directly for command. Both are then surprised when <en name='Pypar' type='other'>Pypar</en> admits that he was sent to the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en> for refusing to give sexual favors to a lord, not for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister as he had previously claimed. Nothing about being sent to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> is fair.
<en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> and <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> swear their oaths to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>.
Convinced, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, along with <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>, say their oath of fealty to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> in front of a heart tree just inside the eaves of the <en name='Haunted Forest' type='other'>Haunted Forest</en> and are acknowledged as men of the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> decided to take the oath with <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to the <en name='Old Gods of the Forest' type='other'>Old Gods of the Forest</en>, as the <en name='Seven' type='other'>Seven</en> gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him. After they take their oaths, <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en> finds a severed hand in the woods and brings it back to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and a horrified <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> tries to convince <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> to invade <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>.
The wine seller is captured after trying to poison <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>.  In <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> attempts to convince <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> about the benefits of an invasion of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>, but <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> is reluctant to cross the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>, despite the thousands of ships they could find in the <en name='Free Cities' type='place'>Free Cities</en> to do the job. He says that a man doesn't need an "iron chair" but only a horse. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> travels to the marketplace with <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en> and her handmaidens. She asks <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> to help convince her husband since the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en> are hers by birthright but he reminds her that her ancestor <en name='Aegon the Conqueror' type='other'>Aegon the Conqueror</en> took six of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>, because he was capable of doing so (due to his dragons), nothing more. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> is delivered a message from <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, a royal pardon for his crimes; he quickly realizes that this news would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy. Seeing <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> with a wineseller who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the <en name='Arbor' type='other'>Arbor</en>, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> realizes that the wine has been poisoned; this is the assassination attempt. Having second thoughts, he steps in and stops <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> from drinking it. The wineseller attempts to flee, but <en name='Rakharo' type='other'>Rakharo</en> brings him down with a bolo tangling his ankles.
With the wine seller captured, Ser <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> tells <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> that <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> <en name='Baratheon' type='other'>Baratheon</en> will never stop trying to kill her and her future children. <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> quickly arrives in the tent. He glares at the seller and then goes to <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> to ensure she is okay, before offering <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> the reward of any horse he chooses for foiling the assassination. Angered, he begins to yell out in <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> that his army will cross the "poison water" as no khalasar has done before and take the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> for his son. <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s khalasar departs <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en> the next morning, with the wine seller tied naked to the saddle of <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> horse, forced to walk until he eventually falls of exhaustion and is dragged to his death.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard Stark</en> meets with <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei Lannister</en>. He tells her that he knows the secret that <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> died for: that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s three children are not <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s, but the product of incest between her and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it, comparing their love to the old <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> practice of marrying brother to sister; she also admits to having despised <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> ever since their wedding night, when <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> drunkenly stumbled into <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s bed and called her "<en name='Lyanna Mormont' type='person'>Lyanna</en>". <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> angrily tells her to take her children and leave the city immediately. When <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> returns from his hunt, he will tell him the truth of the matter and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> should run as far as she can before that happens, lest <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s wrath find her.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> icily calls <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en> a fool for turning down the throne himself after the sack of <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> tells her that he has regrets, but that isn't one of them. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> departs with a chilling warning: "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."
In one of his brothels, <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> instructs the newly-arrived <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> and another prostitute, <en name='Armeca' type='other'>Armeca</en>, on how to please their customers and make them happy. When they ask him to join them, he refuses, saying that he only ever had eyes for one woman. He tells them about his past, how he loved and fought a duel for a woman. He lost and subsequently realized that he could never beat those in power by honorable means, as they would never let him compete on equal terms. When <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> asks him what he wants, he says, "Oh, everything."
<en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en> signs a document confirming <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> as <en name='Protector of the Realm' type='other'>Protector of the Realm</en>.  <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> finds <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> and tells him that <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> finds <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> telling <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> that he wishes he could have been a better father to him. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> chooses not to tell <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> about his discoveries to spare his final hours from pain. <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> instructs <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> to take a letter naming him as the <en name='Protector of the Realm' type='person'>Lord Protector of the Realm</en>, to rule until <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> comes of age. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> does not write <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s name, instead saying "the rightful heir". <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> also asks him to cancel the attempt on <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en>'s life. Leaving the chamber, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> talks to <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, who slyly points out that <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel Lannister</en> ensured the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> kept "refreshed" with alcohol during the hunt, meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> also says it is far too late to stop the attempt on <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> life.
The letter <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en> sends to <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>, informing him of his findings.
At <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> confronts <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> and offers him a hundred swords to take the queen and her children into custody, but <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> refuses to dishonor <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s last hours by shedding blood in the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en> and taking frightened children hostage. <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> suggests that he could make a good king, but <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> angrily points out that <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>'s older brother and the true heir. In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Lord Stannis</en> and instructs a courier to take the message to <en name='Dragonstone' type='place'>Dragonstone</en>, <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s island fortress. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> then arrives and talks to <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>, who tells him the truth about <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s parentage. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> suggests that they keep quiet, acknowledge <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> as king and make him their puppet. If he proves intractable, they can reveal the truth and crown the more malleable <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> instead. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> considers this treason. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> realizes that even though <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> has <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s edict naming him <en name='Regent' type='other'>Regent</en> and <en name='Protector of the Realm' type='other'>Protector of the Realm</en>, he doesn't have the men he needs to seize control from <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>. He needs the loyalty of the <en name='City Watch' type='other'>City Watch</en>. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> understands that the honorable <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> can't come right out and ask him to bribe them, but agrees to do what needs to be done.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> confronts <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en> in the throne room.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> is summoned to the throne room by "<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en>"; <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> has died. He arrives to find <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> waiting for him, along with <en name='Janos Slynt' type='person'>Commander Janos Slynt</en> and a detachment of the <en name='City Watch' type='other'>City Watch</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> tells him that <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> has fled the city, along with <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras Tyrell</en> and a number of retainers. They were last seen heading south. The party enters the throne room, where <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> sits on the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. He demands oaths of fealty from his councilors and subjects. Instead, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> gives <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Ser Barristan Selmy</en> the proclamation naming him as <en name='Protector of the Realm' type='person'>Lord Protector of the Realm</en>. To <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en>'s shock, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> takes the "paper shield" and tears it up. Instead, she suggests that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> bend the knee and swear allegiance. In return he will be allowed to return to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> responds that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> has no claim to the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> and commands <en name='Slynt' type='other'>Slynt</en> to take the <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en> and her son into custody. Instead, the <en name='City Watch' type='other'>City Watch</en> kill <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s bodyguards and <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> holds a knife to his throat, saying, "I did warn you not to trust me."
