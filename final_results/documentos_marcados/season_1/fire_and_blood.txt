At the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en>, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> has been executed by beheading; The great sword <en name='Ice' type='other'>Ice</en> is covered in blood, and <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> standing next to <en name='Ilyn Payne' type='person'>Ser Ilyn Payne</en>, the royal executioner, holds <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en>'s head up to the adulation of the baying crowd. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> has fainted. In the crowd, <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en> drags <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> away, making a point of calling her "<en name='Boy' type='other'>Boy</en>". Once he gets her out of the courtyard, he cuts her hair off with a knife. He tells her that he will get her out of <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> as a recruit of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, but he warns her not to trust the other recruits, since apparently half would hand her over to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> for a pardon, while the other half would do the same, but only after raping her first.
<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is holding court and a singer is brought before him, charged with making up an amusing but offensive song about <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>. The song says that the boar might have killed <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>, but the lion in his bed had previously castrated him. The singer turns out to be <en name='Marillion' type='other'>Marillion</en>, who <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and <en name='Rodrik' type='person'>Ser Rodrik</en> met at the <en name='Inn' type='other'>Inn</en> at the <en name='Crossroads' type='other'>Crossroads</en>, and who accompanied them and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to the <en name='Vale of Arryn' type='other'>Vale of Arryn</en>. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> asks <en name='Marillion' type='other'>Marillion</en> if he wants to keep his hands or tongue. <en name='Marillion' type='other'>Marillion</en> fearfully responds that everyone needs hands. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> commands <en name='Ilyn Payne' type='other'>Ilyn Payne</en> to cut out the tongue instead. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> then takes <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> up to the walls to see her father's head and makes her look at it. He cruelly mocks her, promising he will give her <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s head next. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> quietly retorts that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> might give her <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s instead. Infuriated, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> orders <en name='Meryn Trant' type='person'>Ser Meryn Trant</en> to beat her, as <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> has told him that a king should not hit his queen. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> moves up behind <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, apparently preparing to shove him off the walkway to his death, but unexpectedly <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> dabs the blood off her lip with a handkerchief and after <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> leaves, tells her to give him what he wants.
<en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei Lannister</en> has taken a new lover, her cousin <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> who was <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s squire. She also receives a letter informing her of <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s capture. <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> is naked in <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s bedroom. The thought of being at war is exciting to him, as he has just been made a new young knight. He asks for the news of the war and asks what their next move is, but <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> tells him to shut up and get back in bed.
<en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> takes the prostitute <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> to bed, revealing that he is actually far less frail than he appears. He boasts to <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> of the several great kings he has served, lamenting first how <en name='Aerys Targaryen' type='person'>Aerys Targaryen</en> devolved from a charming young man into a paranoid lunatic obsessed with fire, how <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en> was a great soldier, but perhaps not so ideal a king, before displaying his sycophantic loyalty to <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>.
<en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>.   <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en> has assembled a band of new recruits for the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. Pretending that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is a boy called "<en name='Arry' type='other'>Arry</en>", he has her join the group. Also in the group are <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en>, <en name='Lommy Greenhands' type='other'>Lommy Greenhands</en>, and <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en>, who unknown to him, is <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s bastard son. He had been working for <en name='Tobho Mott' type='other'>Tobho Mott</en>, but with <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> dead, the secret funds being sent to <en name='Mott' type='other'>Mott</en> stopped, so he fired <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> and told him he had to join the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en> and <en name='Lommy' type='other'>Lommy</en> try to bully <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> into giving up <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en>, but she angrily draws the sword, warning that she "has already killed one fat boy" and will happily do it again. <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> breaks up the argument by taking <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>'s side, threatening the boys with violence to keep them from picking on <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> later. <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en> now has to get them all to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, a thousand leagues away, through the war-torn <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>. They set out.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
At <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> has another dream of the three-eyed raven. He wakes up and tells <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> about how the dream always ends with the bird flying into the crypts under the castle, and he tells her he thinks his father is in the tombs. <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> takes <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> down there, and <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> tells her about the histories of some of the ancestors entombed there. They are then surprised by <en name='Shaggydog' type='other'>Shaggydog</en>, <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>'s direwolf, who leaps out at them from the empty future tomb of <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en>. <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> calls <en name='Shaggydog' type='other'>Shaggydog</en> off, then reveals to <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> that he had the same dream. Making their way out, <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> is still trying to tell <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> that it could be a coincidence, but outside they see <en name='Luwin' type='person'>Maester Luwin</en>, who holds a letter and looks at them with such sadness that it is obviously the news of <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s death.
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>
<en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> comforts her son, promising to avenge <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s death  <en name='At Robb' type='other'>At Robb</en>'s camp, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> stoically walks through the encampment and receives the condolences and respect of the northern bannermen, who bow to her as she passes. She makes her way into the woods around the camp.  Once she is out of everyone's sight, she breaks down, practically hyperventilating with grief. Hearing something from deeper in the woods, she finds <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> hacking his sword at a tree in anger and grief. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Lady Catelyn</en> calls to him and tells him he is ruining his sword. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> drops the sword and falls into her arms, vowing to kill the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> who murdered his father. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> comforts him and promises him revenge, but only after they rescue <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> first.
<en name='At Robb' type='other'>At Robb</en>'s camp, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and his bannermen debate what to do in the war against <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en>. They debate whether to align with <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> or <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly Baratheon</en>, but there is no agreement as <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> has greater forces, but <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is elder and next in line of succession (if <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s children are discounted). <en name='Jon Umber' type='person'>Jon Umber</en> becomes irritated and questions why the northerners should be told what to do by rulers in the south at all, reminding them that the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> was once independent of the other <en name='Kingdoms' type='other'>Kingdoms</en> before the <en name='Targaryens' type='other'>Targaryens</en> threatened them with their dragons. With the dragons gone, <en name='Umber' type='other'>Umber</en> declares there is only one king worthy of his respect and allegiance and bows before <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, calling out, "<en name='The King' type='other'>The King</en> in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>!" The other northern bannermen take up the cry and bow before the new <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>, swearing fealty to <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>.
<en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> visits the captive <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en> who taunts her about <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s death and offers to serve her as a lover. She hits him in the head with a rock. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> says that if she keeps hitting him, she can kill him and that he doesn't fear death, though <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> probably realizes that the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> won't kill him as long as his sister holds <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> hostage. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> tells him he has violated the laws of man and gods, and he asks where <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s gods were when his head was cut off (he questions the existence of all gods, the <en name='Old' type='other'>Old</en> and the <en name='New' type='other'>New</en>). She says injustice in the world is because of men like him. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> responds, "There are no men like me, only me". He admits to pushing <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> from the tower, but doesn't reveal why.
At the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> camp, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin</en> is holding a strategy meeting with his generals, and is furious that <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> has been captured by the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en>. Both <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> and <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> have claimed the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>, meaning the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> are now faced with fighting a two-front war against the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> to the north and the <en name='Baratheons' type='other'>Baratheons</en> to the south. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s commanders are uncertain what to do, arguing about whether to strike while they still can, fall back and raise reinforcement armies, or sue for peace. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> points out that any chance of negotiating with <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en> died when his father <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> was executed. <en name='The Lannister' type='person'>The Lannister</en> army is now exposed, so <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> decides to retreat to <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en>, the great castle on the northern shores of <en name='Gods Eye' type='other'>Gods Eye</en>, and use it as a base of operations. Reluctantly impressed by <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s astute judgment of the situation, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> orders his son to go to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and serve as <en name='Acting Hand of the King' type='other'>Acting Hand of the King</en> in <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s stead. He is to bring <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> to heel and prevent the young king from making more idiotic mistakes. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> also tells him to deal with <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, and <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> if he gets so much as a hint of treachery from any of them. He also orders <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to leave his whore behind. Later on in his tent, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> complains about his father to <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>, then decides to defy <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> and take <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> to court anyway.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> learns of his father's death. He saddles a horse and prepares to leave to join <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s army, ignoring <en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en>'s pleas to stay and fulfill his oaths. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> leaves <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, but is pursued. One of his pursuers hits a tree branch and is unhorsed, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> realizes it was <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>. He turns back to help him. The other riders are <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> and <en name='Pypar' type='other'>Pypar</en>. He tells them to go back or they will get in trouble too, but they say they can't go back without him. They surround him and recite their oath to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> realizes they are right: leaving would make him a deserter and oathbreaker, something his father would never countenance if he were alive, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> doesn't even know if <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> would accept his help or turn him over to the authorities. He agrees to return to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> with them.
<en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</en> decides to overlook <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s brief desertion, saying many have fled the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, only to think better of it and return. If they executed everyone who did that, they'd have no men left. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> tells <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that the war between the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> and <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> is less important than what they face now, a renewed threat from the wildlings, <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>, and wights. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> means to lead the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> in force into the <en name='Haunted Forest' type='other'>Haunted Forest</en> to learn more of their foe, to prepare to battle against them, and to find the missing <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen Stark</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> agrees to commit himself fully to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> and all that lies ahead.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> regains consciousness.  In the wastelands beyond <en name='Lhazar' type='other'>Lhazar</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> wakes up to terrible news from <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en>. Her son, <en name='Rhaego' type='other'>Rhaego</en>, is dead. He was born dead and deformed, covered with scales. The majority of the khalasar has also moved on, leaving them behind. However, <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> lives. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> insists on seeing her husband, and finds him a catatonic vegetable. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> demands to know why, and <en name='Mirri Maz Duur' type='other'>Mirri Maz Duur</en> explains that when <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> "saved" her, she had already been raped three times and the temple she served had been burned and defiled by the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en>. They had sacked her village, looted all they owned, and those not killed were enslaved. She has now gotten her revenge, not only on <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>, but on <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> child <en name='Rhaego' type='other'>Rhaego</en>; now her "<en name='Stallion Who Mounts the World' type='other'>Stallion Who Mounts the World</en>" can burn no cities and slaughter no innocents. <en name='Duur' type='other'>Duur</en> agrees that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> saved her life, but she says to ask <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> what life is worth when all else is gone.
It is night, and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is in their tent tending to <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>. She baths him, talks to him, even tries to seduce him, but nothing she does reaches him. She realizes he is no longer there, and seeing him in his vegetative state breaks her heart. Crying, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> kisses him goodbye, then smothers him with a pillow.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> and her small retinue prepare a funeral pyre for <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>. She makes a speech to the few who are left saying that if they wish to go they may, but if they stay with her she will lead them into a glorious future. She frees those of them who are slaves and asks that they stay as equals. The maegi smirks as some people begin walking away. At <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> command, <en name='Rakharo' type='other'>Rakharo</en> places the dragon eggs on the pyre, and <en name='Mirri Maz Duur' type='other'>Mirri Maz Duur</en> is tied to a stake next to the pyre as well. She tells <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> that she will not scream while she is burned alive. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> replies that she only wants the maegi's life. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> believes that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> intends to kill herself and pleads for her to reconsider, as they can sell the eggs and travel far away. Ignoring <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>'s pleas, she kisses his cheek, and sets the pyre alight. <en name='Mirri Maz Duur' type='other'>Mirri Maz Duur</en> does indeed scream as she burns, and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> calmly walks into the flames. She stands below the pyre as flames appear to consume her.
At dawn, the fire dies down. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and the rest of the khalasar awake to find <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> sitting among the still smoldering embers, with three newly-hatched baby dragons crawling over her. Her clothes have burnt away and her body is covered in ash, but she is completely unharmed. One dragon nuzzles in her arm, another climbs her leg, and the third pulls itself up to sit on her shoulder. At the sight of the mythical animals born anew, an amazed <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and the few remaining <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> kneel and swear their allegiance to the <en name='Mother of Dragons' type='other'>Mother of Dragons</en>. After she slowly stands up from the ashes, the black hatchling on her shoulder rises, spreads its wings and screams, announcing the return of dragons to the world.
