In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, while <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> goes on a hunt, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> issues a decree that could splinter the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en> and makes a startling discovery about the heirs to the throne.

<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard Stark</en> wakes up after a long period of unconsciousness, due to the injuries inflicted on him by <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en>'s men. He finds both <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert Baratheon</en> and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei</en> waiting.
<en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s hunting party.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is furious with <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s acts in having her brother <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> arrested and attacking <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> in the street. She wants <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> to take action against him, but <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> refuses to condemn him without hearing <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s side, and tells her to be silent. When <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> protests further, and calls <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> a woman, he hits her. She says that she will wear the bruise with honor. He tells her to be silent, or he will honor her again, and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> leaves in anger. Afterwards, <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> restores <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> to his position as <en name='King 's Hand' type='other'>King 's Hand</en>, and tells him not to quit again, or he will give the position to <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en>. He tells <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> to end the animosity between <en name='House Stark' type='house'>House Stark</en> and <en name='House Lannister' type='house'>House Lannister</en>, as strife between these two powerful houses could lead them into war. He is leaving on a hunt and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns.
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> has another "dancing" lesson with <en name='Syrio Forel' type='other'>Syrio Forel</en>, but isn't in the mood due to <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en>'s death. <en name='Syrio' type='other'>Syrio</en> tells her that she may need to fight at any time, not just when she's in the mood. He wisely reminds her that being prepared to fight is more important in times of sadness than in peaceful times of happiness.
<en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> is out hunting, accompanied by his brother <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>, <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Ser Barristan Selmy</en> and <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel Lannister</en>. <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>, being supplied with wine by <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en>, becomes drunk and nostalgic, longing for the days of young knights trying to make a name for themselves and when enemies stood openly in opposition (instead of being hidden schemers). <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> brags about all the women he has bedded, but <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> becomes irate when he begins to question him about his history with women. <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> calls him a fool and remarks that the past had its share of violence that <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> is conveniently ignoring. <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> storms off, leaving <en name='Barristan' type='person'>Ser Barristan</en> to look on concerned, as <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> keeps up <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s wine supply.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, at a meeting of the small council, a group of refugees come to tell of how their villages have been destroyed. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> hears tales of a huge knight ravaging the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>. He realizes that it's <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor Clegane</en>, "<en name='The Mountain' type='other'>The Mountain</en>", who is likely under <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> orders to punish the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en> - which are held by <en name='House Tully' type='house'>House Tully</en>, the former <en name='House' type='other'>House</en> of his wife <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>, who now holds <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> captive. Even though <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> told him to make peace with the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> could not bring himself to let this injustice stand. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> strips <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor Clegane</en> of his knighthood, land, and titles, and sends <en name='Beric Dondarrion' type='person'>Lord Beric Dondarrion</en> with a retinue of one hundred knights to arrest and execute him in the king's name.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> discovers the secret <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> died for.
He also orders <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> to send word to <en name='Casterly Rock' type='place'>Casterly Rock</en>, demanding <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin Lannister</en>'s presence in court to explain his bannerman's actions or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm. '<en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>' <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en>, and <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s actions against the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>, but <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> wants to see justice done.
<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Prince Joffrey</en> comes to apologize to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> for the incident on the <en name='Kingsroad' type='other'>Kingsroad</en>. He calls her his lady love and gives her a necklace. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> forgives him, and they seem reconciled. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is unaware that the <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en> put <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> up to the apology some time ago.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> decides to send his daughters back to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is worried that she must leave <en name='Syrio' type='other'>Syrio</en>. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor, they are talking about breaking her betrothal to <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> says that he will find someone else for her. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> refuses - she is going to marry <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and have lots of golden-haired babies. This gives <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> pause and sends him back to the book that <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> was looking at before he died. Consulting the book's entry on <en name='House Baratheon' type='house'>House Baratheon</en>, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> finds that every time a <en name='Baratheon' type='other'>Baratheon</en> has married, the children have had black hair... right up to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s children, who are all blond.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
Stiv and <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> accost <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> near <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>.
In <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> has another dream about the three-eyed raven, in which it flies into the castle's crypts. He wakes up to find that <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> has brought the finished saddle designed by <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>. He goes on a ride with <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>. They have had word from <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> about <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s injury, <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en>'s death and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s capture. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> thinks that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> should prepare the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> for war, but <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come, and until then will follow his parents' orders to remain in <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. They discover that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> has wandered off on his horse and go looking for him. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> finds a group of wildlings threatening <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and trying to steal his horse. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> kills two, but another wildling holds <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> with a knife to the throat. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> shoots him from behind, angering <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> by endangering <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>. The remaining wildling, a woman named <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en>, yields and begs for her life. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> agrees to take her as a prisoner.
<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> tells <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> he will miss her as she leaves for <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>.
<en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en>, the prostitute that <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> frequently sees, is departing <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> for <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> on the back of a turnip cart. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> stops her and unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay. She explains that war is now imminent and the men (and thus her customer base) of <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> are destined to leave soon and probably never return; her departure is thus an economically essential decision. He throws her a coin to get her to raise her skirt one last time. As she rides off he says that he will miss her. She agrees that he will.    <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s verbal skills are wasted on <en name='Mord' type='other'>Mord</en>.
In the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>
At the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> almost rolls out of his sky cell in his sleep, to his consternation. He tries to make a bargain with the gaoler, <en name='Mord' type='other'>Mord</en>, to no avail.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> convinces <en name='Mord' type='other'>Mord</en> to carry a message to <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lady Lysa Arryn</en> and, in exchange, he will give <en name='Mord' type='other'>Mord</en> the gold he had with him when he was captured. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> summons <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit, but all he confesses to is being a liar, a whoremonger, and a player of practical jokes. He maintains his innocence of the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> on trial in the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>.
However, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> uses the opportunity of his audience in front of <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en>'s court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial, and <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> is shamed into agreeing. Given that <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en>'s son is a young boy and wouldn't make a good judge in a formal trial, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> instead demands a trial by combat, which <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> also reluctantly agrees is his right. Given that neither <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat, she asks for a volunteer to be her champion, and <en name='Vardis Egen' type='person'>Ser Vardis Egen</en> agrees. <en name='Egen' type='other'>Egen</en> is unwilling to fight <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> however, as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonourable. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> names his own champion: his brother <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm. At this <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> does object, as <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is not present and she does not want to wait. She demands that he pick a champion from those present. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> desperately asks for volunteers, and after a long pause during which it seems that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s cause is lost, the sellsword <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> steps forward and says he will stand for him.    <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> kicks <en name='Vardis Egen' type='person'>Ser Vardis Egen</en>'s corpse out of the <en name='Moon Door' type='other'>Moon Door</en>.
<en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> fights defensively, waiting for <en name='Vardis' type='other'>Vardis</en> to tire, as unlike <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> he is dressed in full armor. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> finally gets his chance; he first wounds and then kills <en name='Vardis' type='other'>Vardis</en>, sending his body rolling out of the "<en name='Moon Door' type='other'>Moon Door</en>" that leads to a thousand-foot drop. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> complains that <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> did not fight with honor. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> agrees, but indicates that <en name='Vardis' type='other'>Vardis</en> did fight with honor. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> has proven his innocence in the eyes of the gods. He retrieves his gold from <en name='Rodrik' type='person'>Ser Rodrik</en> and gives it to <en name='Mord' type='other'>Mord</en>. When <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> asks if he can make the little man fly now, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says, "This little man is going home." <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> are allowed to depart.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> and one of her dragon eggs.
In <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> is studying her dragon eggs. Despite <en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en>'s claim that they are now only stone, she ponders if they might be hatched by extreme heat, and places an egg on a brazier. Nothing happens, to her disappointment. She is removing the egg from the brazier, when <en name='Irri' type='other'>Irri</en> comes in and thinks she will scald herself. <en name='Irri' type='other'>Irri</en> takes the egg from her, but <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is completely unharmed, and it is <en name='Irri' type='other'>Irri</en> who suffers scalding burns on her own hands.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is summoned by the crones who rule the city, the dosh khaleen, the wives of khals slain in battle. She eats a stallion's heart and the crones read the omens. At first it seems <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> won't keep the raw meat down, but, to both her and <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s relief, she is able to compose herself. The crones declare <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> and <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s son will be "<en name='The Stallion That Mounts The World' type='other'>The Stallion That Mounts The World</en>", a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> history. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> says his name will be <en name='Rhaego' type='other'>Rhaego</en>, for her brother <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en>, slain by the usurper <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en>. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> is not impressed and rather disgusted by it all. He stands with <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> who explains the ritual to him. It is only when the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> are chanting <en name='Rhaego' type='other'>Rhaego</en>'s name, and <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> lifts <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> up and carries her about the room, that <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> realizes they love her.
<en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah Mormont</en> prevents <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> from stealing <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en>'s eggs.
He storms out of the tent. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> is later discovered in <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> tent by <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en>, trying to steal <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en>'s dragon eggs, but <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> won't let him. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> tells <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> that to rule one must be feared or loved, and he has never been loved as the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> love <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en>. He says he knows that <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> wants <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, but he doesn't care. He just wants the eggs so he can hire an army, but he can't get past <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> and must leave the eggs. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> watches him as he leaves.
Drunk, bitter and angry, <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> interrupts a feast for <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> and <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>. He angrily demands his payment in return for giving <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> to <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>. Then he draws his sword, which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city, and threatens <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> and the unborn child, while <en name='Irri' type='other'>Irri</en> translates to <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>.
<en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> gives <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> a golden crown.
<en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> responds that he will give <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> a golden crown "that men will tremble to behold", and <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> is pleased until <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s bloodrider <en name='Qotho' type='other'>Qotho</en> breaks his arm, making him drop the sword, and kicks him to the floor. <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> melts his golden belt in a pot, while <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> begs <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> to help him. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> tells her to look away, but she won't. She watches as <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> "crowns" <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> by pouring molten gold over his head, causing <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> to cry out in pure agony. As <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> watches her brother die, she coldly states that, having been killed by fire, <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> was no true dragon.
