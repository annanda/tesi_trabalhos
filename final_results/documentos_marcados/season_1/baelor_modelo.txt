With <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s life in danger, <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en> makes a fateful decision. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> brokers an unsavory deal with the slippery <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder Frey</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> acquires a mistress and is forced by his father to fight on the front lines. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> wins his first major victory and captures a prized prisoner. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is rewarded for his valor and discovers a dark secret about <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en>. As <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en>'s wound festers, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> defies his bloodrider <en name='Qotho' type='other'>Qotho</en> and puts her trust in the enslaved witch <en name='Mirri Maz Duur' type='other'>Mirri Maz Duur</en>.
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>
<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> and <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> outside the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en>.  <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s army has reached the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en>, the heavily-fortified crossing over the <en name='Green Fork of Trident River' type='other'>Green Fork of Trident River</en>. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> shoots down messenger ravens, so no word of their presence can be relayed, but finds nothing more but messages to extended family members. To enter the castle would be perilous for <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, so <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en> enters to negotiate their crossing the river.
Though held by <en name='House Frey' type='house'>House Frey</en>, bannermen to <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en>'s father, <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Lord Walder Frey</en> has not yet taken up arms. When called up, he says he had been preparing to march, and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive. In reality, he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved. Now, as the <en name='Tully' type='other'>Tully</en>'s army has been defeated and <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en> is held by the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>, he wants to know why he should be helping <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and taking up arms against the king. After some hard bargaining between <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en>, they strike a deal: the <en name='Freys' type='other'>Freys</en> will join <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s cause, allow him to cross and commit troops to his army, but in return both <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> must each marry one of <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Walder</en>'s own children. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> agrees, though noting that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> won't like it. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> must also take <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar Frey</en> as a squire.
<en name='The Lannister' type='person'>The Lannister</en> armies prepare for battle. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> tells his son <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he means to use the hill tribe forces to give them an edge against the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> army, essentially to be used as cannon fodder. He orders <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to lead them from the front of the vanguard. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him. He storms back to his tent to find that <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> has found him, as per instruction, a whore named <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> takes an immediate liking to her. When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> goes off to find one for himself.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>, and <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> play a drinking game the night before the battle. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink. He guesses correctly that <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> has been beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and killed someone before he was twelve years old (though it was a woman, not a man, and he killed her in self-defense, because she was coming at him with an axe). <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> guesses that <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>'s mother was a whore, her father deserted them, and she is low born - however he is wrong on each guess. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> cannot read <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>'s personality, but this only makes her more intriguing to him. When <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> starts to question <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> reveals that he heard <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was once married. Reluctantly, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> explains that when he was very young, he and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> were out riding near <en name='Casterly Rock' type='place'>Casterly Rock</en> and found a young common girl in distress from bandits. While <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> chased the bandits off, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> comforted the girl, whose name was <en name='Tysha' type='other'>Tysha</en>. They ended up getting drunk at a local inn, and she became so enamored of him that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> felt like he wasn't an ugly dwarf. Later that night she had sex with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, the first time he was ever with a woman. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> fell madly in love, and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret.
However, two weeks later his father <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> found out, and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> forced <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to reveal the truth: the girl was a prostitute and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> then instructed his guards to have sex with her, with her being paid a silver coin for each man, while <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was forced to watch. <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> points out that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped. As she gets romantic with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> leaves the tent.    <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> leads the hill tribes into battle.  The next morning the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> army finds that the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> have stolen a march on them; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> gives a rousing speech to his hill tribesmen, but as they charge for the front he is first nearly trampled and then knocked out by an accidental blow to the head from someone's club. When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> tells him that the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> won the battle, but it was a feint. As a diversion, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> sent a small portion of his army to confront and delay <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s forces, while the main army marched on <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en> to attack <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s army.    <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is captured by <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s army.      <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en> after his victory.
<en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and <en name='Rodrik Cassel' type='person'>Ser Rodrik Cassel</en> are waiting in woodlands as they hear sounds of battle. Suddenly <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> himself. <en name='The Battle of the Whispering Wood' type='other'>The Battle of the Whispering Wood</en> has lifted the siege of <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en>, and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s army has been destroyed. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, but <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> refuses and has him imprisoned. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> laments that his diversion sent 2,000 men to their deaths. He gives a speech to his army and tells them that they have won a great victory, but the war is far from over.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor Mormont</en> gives his sword <en name='Longclaw' type='other'>Longclaw</en> to <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>.  At <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</en> gives <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> a <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> steel sword, <en name='Longclaw' type='other'>Longclaw</en>, in thanks for saving his life. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> also reinstates <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to his former position and tells him he has dispatched <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Ser Alliser Thorne</en> to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> to lay the hand of the wight they found at the feet of the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> and ask for aid.
<en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> reveals his true identity.
<en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> explains to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that <en name='Longclaw' type='other'>Longclaw</en> was meant for his own son, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en>, but he disgraced himself and fled in exile to <en name='Essos' type='other'>Essos</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> goes to the dining hall and the other recruits make a fuss over the sword, but <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> seems distant from the revelry. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> takes <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> aside and informs him about <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> leading an army south to war. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> ponders that he should be with him, but <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> tells him their duty to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> comes first. To <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s surprise, <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> reveals that his full name is <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon Targaryen</en>, the son of a king, brother to another, the uncle of the <en name='Mad King' type='other'>Mad King</en>. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> had to stand aside and do nothing while his entire family was butchered or exiled during <en name='Robert 's Rebellion' type='other'>Robert 's Rebellion</en>. It is not an easy life they have chosen. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> remarks that he cannot make <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> stay or go; like the <en name='Maester' type='other'>Maester</en>, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> must make the choice himself, and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life.

<en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> after his fall.  Far to the east, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> is concerned that the wound her husband <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> took fighting <en name='Mago' type='other'>Mago</en> has festered and become infected. He falls from his horse, a grave sign of weakness amongst the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> tells the khalasar that they are stopping and requests for <en name='Qotho' type='other'>Qotho</en> to get <en name='Mirri Maz Duur' type='other'>Mirri Maz Duur</en> to help <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>. <en name='Qotho' type='other'>Qotho</en> is unhappy with entrusting <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s care to the woman, whom he calls a maegi or witch, but relents.
At <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> request, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> armors himself. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> also advises her to leave now, because <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> is certain to die and when he dies, his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s son, rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival, but <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> refuses to abandon her husband. <en name='Mirri Maz Duur' type='other'>Mirri Maz Duur</en> promises to save <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s life, but she needs to sacrifice a life in exchange. She takes <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s horse into his tent and starts the ceremony, slitting the animal's throat over <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s comatose form.
<en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah Mormont</en> helps <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>.
Some of <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s warriors become enraged at what they see as <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> attempts to interfere with the natural way of things and <en name='Qotho' type='other'>Qotho</en> tries to attack her, but <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> kills him. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> starts to go into labor, but none of the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> midwives will help her, thinking she is cursed. With no choice, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> takes <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> into the tent as the ceremony continues.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> visits <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> in the dungeons under the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> tells <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> begged for his life before the whole court and that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> is leading an army from the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>. In addition, the <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en> is more concerned over the intentions of <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s brother, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>, a proven battle commander known to be without mercy. For the sake of <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s life, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> urges <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> to confess to treason. In return, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> will let him take the black and join his younger brother <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen</en> and bastard son <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> on the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> is angered by the suggestion that he would trade in his honesty and honor for his life, though he appears to have second thoughts when <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> insinuates that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> would pay the price for his defiance.
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> is living rough on the streets of the city. She catches a pigeon and tries to trade it for a slice of bread, to no avail. She sees crowds moving through the streets and is told that the <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en> is being brought before the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en>, the center of religious worship in the city. Stunned that she will see her father she drops the pigeon and joins the crowd. Unable to see, she climbs unto the pedestal of a statue of <en name='Baelor' type='other'>Baelor</en> (a previous <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> king, <en name='Baelor the Blessed' type='other'>Baelor the Blessed</en>, for whom the <en name='Sept' type='other'>Sept</en> is named). She sees her father being brought in chains to the steps of the temple. He sees <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> on the statue, and as he is dragged through the crowd he passes <en name='Yoren of the Night 's Watch' type='other'>Yoren of the Night 's Watch</en> (who had met <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>). <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> looks at the statue and says, "<en name='Baelor' type='other'>Baelor</en>," puzzling the crowd. <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en> understands, however, and moves toward the statue where <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is watching.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> is given a chance to confess his "crimes." He weighs his choices as he sees both <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> present, and chooses to save them by making a false confession. He says that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is the true <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> on the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>, pleasing him. <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> extols the virtues of mercy and <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> agrees that he could be merciful and send <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> as his mother has suggested and as <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> has begged. He instead acknowledges that as women they are "soft" and treason must never go unpunished. He commands <en name='Ilyn Payne' type='person'>Ser Ilyn Payne</en> to bring him the traitor's head.
<en name='Ilyn Payne' type='person'>Ser Ilyn Payne</en> executes <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en>.
The crowd goes into an uproar. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> tries to make her way through the crowd drawing her sword to save her father, but <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en> grabs and stops her, shielding her from seeing her father's death. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> screams and is restrained by guards. A visibly horrified <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> frantically tries to persuade her son to reconsider, as does <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, but there is no time. Forced to kneel, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> looks at the statue and sees that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> has been rescued by <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en>, and is relieved that she is safe. <en name='Ilyn' type='person'>Ser Ilyn</en> draws <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s own sword, <en name='Ice' type='other'>Ice</en>, and cuts his head off with a single blow. A flock of pigeons takes flight immediately afterwards, the sight being all <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> needs to know her father is dead.
