<en name='The Night 's Watch' type='other'>The Night 's Watch</en> takes stock; <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> meets his better; <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is taken to the commander of the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en>; <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> makes an exchange.
In the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en> has had his sword-hand cut off by <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>. The following day, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>'s men lead their prisoners <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Brienne of Tarth' type='other'>Brienne of Tarth</en> back to <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en> on horseback. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> is gaining maximum enjoyment from torturing someone who can't possibly fight back: he ties <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s severed right hand onto a rope and hangs it around <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s neck, forcing <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to smell as the flesh of his own hand rots. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is physically in agony from his wound, feverish and half-delirious. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> can barely stay conscious, and he falls headlong off of his horse into the mud. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> has been tormenting <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> by not giving him water and he is almost dying of thirst. One of <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>'s men moves to give him water but instead empties the canteen over <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s head to taunt him. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> weakly tries to point out that if he actually dies <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> and his men will be in serious trouble, but <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> simply dismisses this. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> then hands him a container, which he desperately guzzles down rapidly, too weak to notice what it is. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> then points out that he filled the container with horse piss just to torment <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, who spits out what he can. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> can barely move, but <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> viciously kicks him repeatedly. In a surge of effort <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> manages to steal the sword from one of <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>'s men, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand, much less wield a sword - and he cannot fight as well with his left hand as he could his sword-hand. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> soon realizes this, and actually isn't trying to fight them off any more, but instead to provoke one of them to kill him so he doesn't have to go on living like this and can die with the small dignity of having a sword in his hand. He succumbs to exhaustion and <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> doesn't even bother to punish him this time, just warning him that if he tries that again he'll cut off his other hand.
Later that night <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> are restrained near a campfire. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> refuses to eat, and says he wants to die. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> says he should try to live for revenge, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> says he was that hand, and without his sword-hand, even if he escapes, he is nothing, and would rather die as the <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> he was than go on living, robbed of his very identity. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> grows angry, insinuating to <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> that this is the first time he's had to face the real world where things people care about get taken away, but he's pathetically moping around like a woman. Her criticism and strength convinces <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to start eating. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> says she overheard when he earlier managed to talk <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> out of letting his men gang-rape her, by convincing him that her father will pay <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> her weight in sapphires. While <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> is a noblewoman and worth a ransom, <en name='Tarth' type='other'>Tarth</en> is called "the <en name='Sapphire Isle' type='other'>Sapphire Isle</en>" due to the color of the seas around it, not because there are any actual sapphires, and <en name='House Tarth' type='house'>House Tarth</en> is not particularly rich. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> is completely confused, and asks <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> why he helped her, but he doesn't answer.
<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>' long awaited revenge.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> meets with <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, who is in the middle of prying open a large wooden crate. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> asks <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> to help him confirm who sent <en name='Mandon Moore' type='person'>Ser Mandon Moore</en> to kill him during the <en name='Battle of the Blackwater' type='place'>Battle of the Blackwater</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> says he would like to help, but the most he has are whispers that it was <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, but only whispers, and he cannot confirm who gave the order. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> wants to know with certainty if it was his sister so he can take revenge. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> uses this opportunity to finish a conversation they were having on the eve of the battle, in which <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> promised to reveal how he was castrated. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> says that he used to be a slave in a travelling troupe that passed through all of the <en name='Free Cities' type='place'>Free Cities</en>, but once when he was in <en name='Myr' type='other'>Myr</en> he was sold to a sorcerer. The sorcerer gave him a potion which temporarily paralyzed him while still leaving him fully aware and able to experience pain, and then he cut his genitals off, root and stem (shaft and testes). The sorcerer needed his genitals as a sacrifice for a spell, and he burned <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>' genitals in a brazier of fire. What <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> has had recurrent nightmares about to this day is not the sorcerer, or the knife, or the pain... but that when the sorcerer prayed to the blue flames in his ceremony, a voice clearly answered him from the flames. Whether it was a god or a demon or simply parlor tricks, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> never knew, as the sorcerer threw him out into the street to die. But he was determined to live, to spite the sorcerer, and one day get his revenge on him. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> did whatever it took to claw his way up into a position of influence in the world: first, to survive he would beg, steal, or sell the sexual use of the parts of his body he still had. Increasingly, he discovered that stealing men's secrets was far more profitable than anything physical which could be stolen, and in time, he worked his way up from the slums of <en name='Myr' type='other'>Myr</en> to the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. This is why <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> has always hated those who claim to wield magical powers, and particularly why he opposed <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>, who relies on the <en name='Red Priestess Melisandre' type='other'>Red Priestess Melisandre</en>. As <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> finishes his long tale, he finally finishes prying the last nail out of the crate and opens it. To <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s astonishment, it contains an elderly sorcerer, the very same one that castrated <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> so many years ago. He is still alive but gagged, and was shipped to <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> in the crate. Using his own life as an example, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> thus urges <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to be patient, and his revenge will come to him in time. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> then closes the crate, with the sorcerer still inside.
<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> visits <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en>, who has been secretly spying on <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> for him. He is surprised to hear her report from the other prostitutes in the brothel on the prodigious activities of one <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> is perplexed as to what exactly happened; <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> says the girls told her he wasn't particularly large or anything, so much as what he did, but when she repeatedly asked them what exactly that was, the most they could say is that it was "hard to describe." She then reports on how frequently <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> has visited <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>, and says she thinks he is obsessed with her, and wants to smuggle her out of the city. He asks why she thinks this is true, and she presents a stolen copy of the ship's manifest for the boat that will take <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> to the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> is surprised that <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> is literate and asks what obvious point it is that he doesn't see. She points out that there will be two feather beds, and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> realizes <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> would only pay the extra money for someone other than <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> if it was <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> in the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en>.      <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> wave at the pleased crowd.  <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> gives <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> a tour of the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en>, where their royal wedding is to be held, as <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei Lannister</en> and <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna Tyrell</en> follow. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> excitedly relates tales of the darker chapters of the <en name='Great Sept' type='other'>Great Sept</en>'s history, to <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>'s feigned interest and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s annoyance. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> asks if <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en> was buried with the <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> kings in the <en name='Great Sept' type='other'>Great Sept</en>; <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> explains that he left instructions to return his remains to <en name='Storm 's End' type='other'>Storm 's End</en>. When <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> dismisses the accident that claimed <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s life, <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> laments her son's total lack of military prowess. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> points out that <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en>'s son <en name='Mace Tyrell' type='person'>Lord Mace Tyrell</en> besieged <en name='Storm 's End' type='other'>Storm 's End</en> for almost a full year during <en name='Robert 's Rebellion' type='other'>Robert 's Rebellion</en>, but <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> scoffs that her oaf of a son is no warrior and the only thing he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> muses on the shortcomings of the men in their lives and the arrangement of patriarchy in general, to which <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> wistfully says that it is the will of the gods. Thus distracted, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> convinces <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> to greet the crowd outside. Having been somewhat placated by <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>'s charity, the crowd happily cheers for the pair of them. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> realizes she has lost control of <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> to the <en name='Tyrells' type='other'>Tyrells</en>.
Subsequently, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> meets with her father <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> in his chambers. She wants to ensure that he is doing everything he can to find <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> dismissively points out that he started a war when his hated dwarf son <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was captured by the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en>, so assuredly he is willing to do even more now for his elder son. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> makes it clear that he considers <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> his heir - despite the fact that as a <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> member, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> has officially renounced all rights to inheritance. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> previously noted that he is next in line of succession after <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, as a younger son inherits before an older daughter, but <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> said he would never let his hated dwarf son be his heir. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> points out that (as she is next in line of succession) maybe <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> should consider her the real heir to his legacy, not his sons. She claims she is the only one of his children who ever took his lectures on family and legacy seriously. She points out that for a man who pays a lot of lip service to "family" and "legacy," he excludes her from his plans. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> confirms that he excludes <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> from his plans, but not because she is a woman: he distrusts her because she isn't nearly as smart as she thinks she is. He sneers that she has allowed <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> to run roughshod over her, the city and its people, and that he intends to rein in his grandson's deranged behavior. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> says she is afraid of the growing influence of the <en name='Tyrells' type='other'>Tyrells</en> at court, and something must be done about them. In particular, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is nervous about how skilled <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery Tyrell</en> is at manipulating <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> bluntly responds that it's good someone has finally been able to manipulate <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, as <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> herself has clearly proven to be incapable of doing it. She says <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> should try stopping <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> from doing what he likes (implying he will find it extremely difficult), but her father firmly responds, "I will."
<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> and <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> discuss <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>  Meanwhile, <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> is seated in the gardens with two of <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>'s cousins. One of them embroiders a golden <en name='Tyrell' type='other'>Tyrell</en> rose with their motto, "<en name='Growing Strong' type='other'>Growing Strong</en>," which prompts <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> to complain that their family has the dullest sigil and motto in the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>. Other families have interesting mottos like "<en name='Winter' type='other'>Winter</en> is Coming" or "<en name='We Do Not Sow' type='other'>We Do Not Sow</en>," and have direwolves and krakens for sigils. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> arrives to meet with <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> and she shoos the girls away. They walk through the gardens, and while <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> remains relatively polite she instantly sees through all of <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>' pleasantries. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> is verbally outmatched, for once, and she asks him to just get to the point. He says that he is extremely worried that <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> is going to try to take control of <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>: with <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>'s younger brothers presumed dead at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> missing and presumed dead for over a year, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s only heir. <en name='The War of the Five Kings' type='other'>The War of the Five Kings</en> is not going well for the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> now, and if <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> were to be defeated and die, the man who controls <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> controls the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> says that while he enjoys sparring with <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>, he is truly horrified by the man. While they are all engaged in the intrigues and murders of court politics, <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> has utterly no limits on what he will do to achieve power: he would burn the entire realm down if it meant he could be king of the ashes. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> agrees and says that the solution is rather obvious.
Shortly thereafter, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery Tyrell</en> finds <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> praying in the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>'s godswood, overlooking <en name='Blackwater Bay' type='other'>Blackwater Bay</en>. She dismisses the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guards (threatening to tell the king they refused her if they don't leave) and engages in pleasant small-talk. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> plays a small joke on <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> by saying that her cousin died of a pox which made her face melt off, but is just trying to brighten her spirits (though in the process is reminded that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is still somewhat naïve). <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> then invites <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to visit <en name='Highgarden' type='other'>Highgarden</en> in the <en name='Reach' type='other'>Reach</en> someday. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is confused, as <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei</en> won't allow her to leave the city, but <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> wryly points out that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Regent Cersei</en> might not want her to, but <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Queen Margaery</en> would be happy to share <en name='Highgarden' type='other'>Highgarden</en>'s pageantry with a friend... or a sister. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> points out that if <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> were to marry <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>, then she would belong in <en name='Highgarden' type='other'>Highgarden</en> anyway. The thought of finally escaping <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, being wed to her idol and becoming a <en name='Tyrell' type='other'>Tyrell</en> makes <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> choke out tears of joy.
<en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> is brought before the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en> to answer for his crimes.  Elsewhere in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> and <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> are kept hooded as <en name='Thoros of Myr' type='other'>Thoros of Myr</en> and his men lead them into a cave, <en name='Hollow Hill' type='other'>Hollow Hill</en>, which serves as the secret hideout of the <en name='Brotherhood Without Banners' type='other'>Brotherhood Without Banners</en>. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> "<en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en>" <en name='Clegane' type='other'>Clegane</en> is brought with them in restraints, and is confronted by the leader of the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en>, <en name='Beric Dondarrion' type='person'>Ser Beric Dondarrion</en>. <en name='Beric' type='person'>Ser Beric</en> was commanded by none other than <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> to lead a group of soldiers to track down and bring to justice the false knight <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor Clegane</en>, when he started raiding the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en> under <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en>'s orders at the very beginning of the <en name='War of the Five Kings' type='other'>War of the Five Kings</en>. They subsequently became trapped behind <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> lines, but continued to harass their forces by forming the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en>. Over time, however, they began to realize how much suffering was being inflicted on the smallfolk of the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en> by <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> and <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> forces alike, and began to defend the commoners from raiders from both sides of the war. Over time they were joined by <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> deserters, <en name='Baratheon' type='other'>Baratheon</en> deserters, and commoners who want to defend their homes.
<en name='Dondarrion' type='other'>Dondarrion</en> says he's still following the mission that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> set him on, to bring <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor Clegane</en> to justice and restore <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s peace to the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>. <en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> balks that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> and <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> are dead now, and he can't just be fighting for ghosts, but <en name='Dondarrion' type='other'>Dondarrion</en> says that now the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en> are ghosts, attacking the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> where they least expect them, melting away back to their hideouts in the woods. <en name='The Brotherhood' type='other'>The Brotherhood</en> points out that the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> "lions" have been butchering the innocent. At the outbreak of the war, <en name='Dondarrion' type='other'>Dondarrion</en>'s group were ambushed in the <en name='Battle' type='other'>Battle</en> at the <en name='Mummer 's Ford' type='other'>Mummer 's Ford</en>, where girls as young as seven were raped and babies were cut in half in front of their parents. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> points out that he wasn't at <en name='Mummer 's Ford' type='other'>Mummer 's Ford</en>. <en name='The Brotherhood' type='other'>The Brotherhood</en> continues to cite various <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> crimes: <en name='Thoros' type='other'>Thoros</en> says he was there during the <en name='Sack of King 's Landing' type='other'>Sack of King 's Landing</en> and saw the butchered corpses of the royal children, <en name='Rhaenys' type='other'>Rhaenys</en> and <en name='Aegon Targaryen' type='person'>Aegon Targaryen</en>. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> continues to point out that he wasn't present for these crimes and many of them were in fact committed by his older brother <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en> (who personally killed the baby <en name='Aegon Targaryen' type='person'>Aegon</en>, then raped and killed his mother <en name='Elia Martell' type='person'>Elia</en>). <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> says that they can't kill him for the crime of being born into <en name='House Clegane' type='house'>House Clegane</en> and being related to <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en>. He also scoffs at how <en name='Dondarrion' type='other'>Dondarrion</en> and many of his men have converted to the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> religion, of which <en name='Thoros' type='other'>Thoros</en> is a priest. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> then speaks up, and angrily accuses <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> of killing her friend <en name='Mycah' type='other'>Mycah</en>, the butcher's boy, then slinging his corpse over his horse like a deer. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> matter-of-factly admits that he killed <en name='Mycah' type='other'>Mycah</en>, but says he was in no place to question then-<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Prince Joffrey</en>'s orders. <en name='The Brotherhood' type='other'>The Brotherhood</en>, closing in on something <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> actually did, charge him with the crime of following orders to kill <en name='Mycah' type='other'>Mycah</en>, but that they will give him a fair trial: <en name='Dondarrion' type='other'>Dondarrion</en> himself will face <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> in a trial by combat.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en> is having a shared greensight dream with <en name='Jojen Reed' type='other'>Jojen Reed</en>. They are walking through the woods and see the three-eyed raven again. <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> advises <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> that he must follow the raven, and when he is confused, <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> points out that he must follow it by climbing a tree. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> begins to climb the tree that the raven has landed in but he soon becomes terrified, remembering the fall that crippled him when he was climbing a tower at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. He sees a vivid dream-memory of his mother <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>, repeating her warning in which she made him promise never to climb again - a promise which he broke, and thus indirectly led to the fall which crippled him. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> is so terrified of the memory of <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> yelling at him that he falls off the tree. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> wake in their camp in the woods, disappointed that he could not follow the three-eyed raven.
Elsewhere, apparently in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> is being led by the boy who set him free from the dungeon and then rescued him by killing his captors when they tried to recapture him. He says that he is leading <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> to <en name='Deepwood Motte' type='other'>Deepwood Motte</en>, a castle on the west coast of the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> which was captured by his sister <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en>. He says he is concerned that some of the guards may betray <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>, so it is best to sneak into the castle through the drains until they reach his sister in person. As the boy fumbles around with keys at a locked gate, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> sinks to the ground and asks if his father <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> knows he was taken captive; the boy says he doesn't know but <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> says he probably did but left him for dead. Filled with remorse, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> laments that his real father died when his head was cut off in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, that he had a choice between two families, and he chose wrong. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> says that now, he has destroyed everything he ever cared about, and his real home <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> is burned to the ground. He also says the only thing he ever resented about <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en> is that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> could effortlessly be the kind of good man that <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> truly wanted to be but had to struggle against his own failings to be like. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> even apologizes aloud for having two innocent orphan boys killed, so in desperation he could pass them off as <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon Stark</en>. The boy is surprised, and <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> explains to him that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> escaped, so he had to fake their deaths so he wouldn't seem weak.
The boy leads <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> into a dark chamber in the castle, and he calls out for <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en>. The boy then lights a torch... revealing the same <en name='X-shaped' type='other'>X-shaped</en> cross that <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> was chained to when he was being tortured before. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> was led in a complete circle, back to the very same dungeon he "escaped" from in the first place. Other guards come in and the boy shouts to tie <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> up again, where he belongs, and that it was <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> who killed the other guards when he tried to escape (instead of him). The boy, giving commands, is revealed to be one of the head torturers, and <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s entire "escape" that he led him on was nothing more than another form of torture, sadistically toying with him.
<en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>
At <en name='Craster 's Keep' type='place'>Craster 's Keep</en>, tensions run high among the members of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> who sought shelter there after escaping the devastating defeat at the <en name='Battle of the Fist of the First Men' type='other'>Battle of the Fist of the First Men</en>. <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> and <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> are shoveling pig-shit, but the former rapist <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> urges them that they are not safe here and cannot trust <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>: the man sacrifices his own newborn sons to the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>, and there's every probability that if the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> do come, he'll hand over the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> survivors to his real masters. <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> and <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> don't want to discuss it.
<en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> visits <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en>, who is deeply distraught about the fate of her newborn son. She is frantic, and yells at <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> not to draw attention to the fact that it's a boy by calling it a "he" so loud, as <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> will want to offer it up as a sacrifice when he finds out it's a son. He asks her if she's decided on a name, but she responds that there's no point in naming her baby if he's only going to be offered up as a human sacrifice. She gives <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> back his mother's thimble and says she doesn't care about such stupid things, all she's focused on is protecting the life of her baby.
Some of their wounded have died from their injuries, and <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</en> leads a funeral service as they burn the corpse of a man named <en name='Bannen' type='other'>Bannen</en> on a pyre. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> didn't know the man well, but he rode bravely into the unknown lands far beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, fought valiantly at the <en name='Fist' type='other'>Fist</en> against monsters which they didn't even know existed, and they will never see a man that brave again. He closes the eulogy with the traditional closing line for members of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, "And now, his watch is ended," which the assembled men repeat.
In the main hall, <en name='Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Mormont</en> is checking a map in his journal, as <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> continues to crassly berate the men of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> says that they have to stay long enough for their wounded to recover sufficiently to be fit to travel, but <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> waves this off, saying they've recovered as much as they ever will. <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> openly suggests that they should just kill the men who are so severely wounded that they won't be able to travel, and if <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> is reluctant to do the deed himself, he can just leave and <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> will finish them off. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> declines. Another young <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> man, <en name='Karl Tanner' type='other'>Karl Tanner</en>, comes in to complain that <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> is feeding them nothing but bread cut with sawdust, and he wants to know where <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> keeps his hidden larder. Meanwhile, <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> is sitting there getting quite drunk on the wine they gifted to him when they first came. <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> joins in the accusations, and <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> admits that he has winter stockpiles, but he needs those to feed his women and refuses to share them. <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> calls <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> a bastard - at which <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> becomes enraged and threatens <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> with an axe. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> restrains <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en>, and <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> shouts that he's throwing them all out to lie down outside in the cold on their empty bellies. <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> says he will chop the hands off the next man who calls him "bastard." A tense moment of silence passes, and <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> grabs <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> to lead him out the doorway...
<en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> is murdered.  ...when <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en>, firmly staring directly at <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>, challenges him and calls him a "daughter-fucking, wildling bastard," <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> lunges forward at <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> in a blind rage, but he is drunk and clumsy: without flinching, <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> holds off <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s axe with his left hand, while using his right hand to ram a dagger through the old man's throat, which goes up into the roof of his mouth. He flings the dying <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> to the ground, then punches one of <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s wives who is present, demanding to know where the hidden food is kept. <en name='Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Mormont</en> bellows that the gods will curse him for this, as a guest killing a host who has formally accepted him into his home breaks all the laws of gods and men. <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> shouts that there are no laws beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>. <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> continues to threaten the girl with a knife, so <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> draws his sword, which makes <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en> drop the girl and begin to face off against <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> with his dagger. Suddenly, <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> comes up behind <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> and literally stabs the <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en> in the back, which makes <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> drop his sword. For a brief moment the men stare in shock, then <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> charges and tackles <en name='Karl' type='other'>Karl</en>. The entire room explodes into pure bedlam.
The desperate <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> recruits like <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en>, mostly conscripted criminals exiled to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, turn on officers who are loyal to <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en>, as well as some of the other common recruits like <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> who stay loyal. Quick flashes of the fight go by as no one can really perceive what's happening, and the mutiny spreads throughout <en name='Craster 's Keep' type='place'>Craster 's Keep</en>. In the midst of it, <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> turns around to fight off <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en>. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> may have a knife in his back but he is twice <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en>'s size and completely enraged. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> grabs <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> by the throat and lifts him off his feet, one-handed, then spins him around and hurls him against the opposite wall. Still choking <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en>, <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> nearly succeeds in crushing <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en>'s windpipe with his bare hand - but then <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> starts to cough up thick red blood. His knife wound is mortal. The injured <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> then sinks to the ground and continues to cough up blood. Now that <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> is on the ground unarmed and helpless, <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> grabs a knife and repeatedly pounds it into <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en>'s throat until the <en name='Old Bear' type='other'>Old Bear</en> is dead. Meanwhile, <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> rushes to <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en>'s hut and orders her that they have to escape now or they never will. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> runs out of <en name='Craster 's Keep' type='place'>Craster 's Keep</en> with <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> and her baby, as loyal <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> members fall to the mutineers, who also kill or rape <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s other wives. <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> leads the way into the night because she knows the woods around her home. Covered in <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en>'s blood, <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> shouts into the darkness that "<en name='Piggy' type='other'>Piggy</en>" can run for now, but he'll soon be cutting <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>'s throat too.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
At the city of <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en> in <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> arrives before <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> mo <en name='Nakloz' type='other'>Nakloz</en> and the other slave-masters of the city, with her <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> guards carrying the largest of her dragons, <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en>, in its large cage. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is accompanied by her <en name='Queensgard' type='other'>Queensgard</en> members, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en> and <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Ser Barristan Selmy</en>. <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> the translator, gifted to <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> at her request, is now dressed in higher-quality clothing which matches <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en>'s style of dress. All eight thousand of the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> warrior-eunuchs are gathered in the city's main square for the transaction. The other upper-class men and women of <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en> crowd around the square, gawking at the dragon while slaves in heavy chains serve them refreshments.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> reveals <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en>.  <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> tells <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, via <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en>'s interpretation in the <en name='Low Valyrian' type='other'>Low Valyrian</en> language, that many of the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> have not yet seen battle, so she would do well to attack some minor cities and towns here and there on her way to <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. The slavers will happily purchase any slaves she captures, so it's a win-win situation. He also wryly notes that any young boys she sells as slaves will be castrated and ready to serve as new <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> when their training is over in about ten years' time. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> lets her dragon out of its cage, and leads it on a long chain leash attached to its foot as it hovers about twenty feet in the air. She hands the leash to <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en>, and in return he gives her a cat-o-nine-tails with a hilt shaped like a <en name='Harpy' type='other'>Harpy</en>, signifying ownership of the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> asks if it is done, and <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> impatiently says that it is, as he struggles to rein in the dragon.
To the surprise of <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> calls the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> to attention in <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en>, and proceeds to test them with basic <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> marching commands. She smiles slightly, knowing they are now hers. Too distracted to notice, <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> complains for <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> to tell "the bitch" that the dragon won't come when he commands. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> turns to face <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> and bluntly says "A dragon is not a slave," again in perfectly-accented <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en>. When a dumbfounded <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> demands an explanation, she declares that she is <en name='Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen' type='other'>Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen</en>, of the blood of <en name='Old Valyria' type='other'>Old Valyria</en>: <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> is her mother-tongue indicating she'd been feigning ignorance the entire time (and putting up with <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en>' insulting comments) to lull them into a false sense of security.
<en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> burns <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en>      <en name='The Unsullied' type='other'>The Unsullied</en> sack <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en>.  <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> then addresses the thousands of <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en>, and orders them to kill all of the slave masters in <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en>, along with all of their household soldiers and any man who holds a whip. She cautions them to spare any children, and to strike the chains off any slave they see. <en name='The Unsullied' type='other'>The Unsullied</en> obey her commands without question, and instantly begin attacking all of the assembled slave-masters. <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> frantically shouts for someone to kill <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, to which she calmly orders "dracarys." <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> breathes fire onto <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en>, completely engulfing the slaver in flames as he thrashes about in his death throes. Her dragon then flies across the upper walls where the other high-ranking slave masters are watching, burning them all to death. <en name='The Unsullied' type='other'>The Unsullied</en> proceed to sack the entire city, slaughtering the slave masters and freeing fellow slaves, supported by the fire of <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> dragons.
After the Sack of <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en> is finished, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> walks past <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en>' charred remains, mounts a white horse, and addresses her <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en>. She declares that they have spent their entire lives as slaves, but now she sets them free. If any man wishes to leave, she will not stop him, and no harm will come to him if he goes. She asks the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> to stay and fight for her, not as slaves but as free men. For a moment the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> stare blankly: they have never known what freedom is. Then one starts tapping the end of his spear against the ground in support, and the others join in, until thousands of <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> are triumphantly striking their spears against the ground in praise of <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>. She has what her brother dreamed about for seventeen years but could never find: an army with which to reconquer the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> marches forward with her army and <en name='Dragons' type='other'>Dragons</en>.  <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> rides triumphantly out of the smoking wreck of <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en>, and drops the slave-master's whip on the ground. <en name='The Unsullied' type='other'>The Unsullied</en> trample the whip under their feet as they march past. She rides out with her eight thousand strong army of <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> marching in formation, as her three dragons fly above them. For the first time in generations, a <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> has begun to conquer again, begining the <en name='Liberation of Slaver 's Bay' type='other'>Liberation of Slaver 's Bay</en>.
