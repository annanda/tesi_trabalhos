At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
After surviving the perilous climb of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>, <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en>, and the wildlings led by <en name='Tormund Giantsbane' type='other'>Tormund Giantsbane</en> make their way towards <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>  to await <en name='Mance Rayder' type='other'>Mance Rayder</en>'s signal to begin the attack on the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. Afterwards <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> confronts <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en> about cutting his and <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en>'s rope loose on <en name='The Wall' type='other'>The Wall</en>, nearly killing the both of them in the process. <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en> tells <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that he doesn't see <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> complaining about what happened because she is a wildling and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation, also telling <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her. During the journey through the woods, a clearly jealous <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en> confronts <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> and says that he would be a better man for her than <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>, while continuing to express his distrust in <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> also tries to persuade <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> that the wildlings' cause is doomed to failure, but she refuses to listen and points out that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is technically one of them; if it fails, so does he. She renews her passion for him and tells him bluntly that if they die, they die, but before they die they will live in each other.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en>'s army marches on to the next great city of <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>, <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>. She and <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='other'>Barristan Selmy</en> are confident they can take the city, given that <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> are famous for training bed slaves rather than soldiers.  <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> notes with wisdom however that <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>'s defenders won't fight them in open battle, being more likely to hole up behind their walls and chip away at the <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> army with guerrilla tactics. He also advises <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> that conquering <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> does not help them with their main goal of pressing on to retake <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> however is adamant on freeing the slaves of <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>, who number in the hundreds of thousands. She orders <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> to send a messenger to the city and inform <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>'s slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer the same fate as <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en>.
The Yunkish herald is carried into <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s camp on a litter carried by slaves, along a road flanked by <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en>. <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> announces the newcomer as <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> mo <en name='Eraz' type='other'>Eraz</en>, one of the ruling "<en name='Wise Masters' type='other'>Wise Masters</en>" of <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> meets the man in her pavilion, flanked by her dragons who vie for her attention and fight over the pieces of meat she tosses to them; they also snarl at <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> when he gets too close. <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> declares that <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> was an ancient civilization long before the rise of <en name='Valyria' type='other'>Valyria</en> and that numerous armies throughout history have tried and failed to conquer it. However <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is not threatened, commenting that a hard-fought battle would give her <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> much needed practice. <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> tries a different tact, asserting there is no need for their factions to fight, that <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> is willing to overlook her attack on <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en> and will even provide her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. In exchange, they ask that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> leave <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> in peace.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> makes a counter-offer: she will spare the lives of <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> and the slave-masters of <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> if every slave (men, women and children) in the city is set free, and given as much food, clothing and property as they can carry in payment for their services. She warns that if her offer is rejected, <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> will be shown no mercy. <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> takes offense, promising that <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en> will be more of a challenge for her than <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en> or <en name='Qarth' type='other'>Qarth</en>, and threatens her with the retribution of <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>'s "powerful friends" who he claims will take great pleasure in destroying her army and enslaving the survivors. At that, <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> and his siblings roar in anger; <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> protests that he was promised safe conduct, to which <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> counters that her dragons made no such promise and take offense to him threatening their mother. After the dragons prevent his slaves from reclaiming the chests of gold he brought with him, <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> storms out of the pavilion, muttering curses. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> tells <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> to find out more about <en name='Yunkai' type='other'>Yunkai</en>'s "powerful friends" before she commits herself to an attack on the city.
In the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>
Traveling back from the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, a ship carrying <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> and <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> leaves <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and passes through <en name='Blackwater Bay' type='other'>Blackwater Bay</en>. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> stares at the broken wrecks of <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s fleet destroyed by the wildfire, asserting that her presence might have turned the tide of battle. She questions <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> and is surprised to learn he is unaware of his father's real identity. As they pass by the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> reveals to <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> that he is <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert Baratheon</en>'s bastard son.
In The <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>, on their way to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en>'s party makes camp. <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> remains distrustful of <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> and <en name='Jojen Reed' type='other'>Jojen Reed</en> and reacts with horror when they mention they intend to go beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>. <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> bluntly refuses to go, explaining that she lost her husband, who then rose from the dead and tried to kill her. She rages that none of them understand what lies beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and that there is nothing left for men there.
At the camp of the <en name='Brotherhood Without Banners' type='other'>Brotherhood Without Banners</en>, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, disillusioned with the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en> for selling <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en>, takes an opportunity to escape and runs off into the night. Before she gets too far, however, she is snatched up by <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en>, who was lying in wait for her.
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, en route to <en name='The Twins' type='other'>The Twins</en>, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>'s army is forced to make camp, their progress delayed by heavy rain. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> warns them that the prickly <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Lord Walder Frey</en> will take the delay as a deliberate insult to him, but <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure Tully</en> points out that <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> is getting the wedding he wanted; his sister counters that he is getting a wedding, but not the one he wanted, glaring at her son and his wife as she says so, pointing out that <en name='Frey' type='other'>Frey</en> wanted one of his daughters wed to a king. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> retorts that <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> is the best match <en name='House Frey' type='house'>House Frey</en> has been offered in its history. Later that night, as <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and <en name='Talisa' type='other'>Talisa</en> prepare for bed, she tells him she is pregnant with his child. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> is gladdened by the news.
At his prison, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> is released from the cross to which he is chained by two beautiful girls. The women lay <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> down on a bed and then proceed to dramatically seduce him. They say repeatedly that they have heard that the heir to <en name='Pyke' type='other'>Pyke</en> is well endowed and are hoping to get first hand experience. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> is distrustful at first, fearing that this is another of his tormenter's tricks. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> cannot help himself but be aroused when one of the women who has become naked straddles him and begins a rocking motion. Suddenly, the familiar horn sounds and the boy enters. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> is terrified and tries to escape, but is struck hard on the head and is flung to the ground. The boy claims he too has heard about <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s famous body part and announces it must very well be his favorite body part. When the sadistic youth brandishes an odd knife, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> realizes the boy means to remove his penis. Horrified, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> begs for mercy, but the boy quips that this is mercy as he's not killing <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>, merely altering him. Two large men hold a screaming <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> down while the boy moves in to castrate him.
At <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, neither <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> or <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> are particularly happy about their impending marriage. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery Tyrell</en> consoles <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, reminding her that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is far from the worst <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> and that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> might be able to make her happy, given his skill as a lover. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>, meanwhile, points out to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he can easily wed <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and get a son and heir from her to placate his father and keep having sex with <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> in private, thereby getting two women and a kingdom to rule for himself. However, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is concerned his mistress isn't going to be so willing to go along with that plan and is less than enthusiastic about having a wife, a mistress and the entire <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> despising him. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> points out that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is wasting his time trying to be universally loved. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s fears prove accurate as <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> bluntly tells him that she will no longer sleep with him after he weds <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>.
Meanwhile, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> enters the throne room to answer a summons from <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en>. After exchanging some false courtesy <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> asks why his grandson wished to see him. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> wants an update on what the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> has been doing. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> informs <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> that the king can attend any <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> meeting should he desire it. The boy king claims that he is too busy to attend said meetings and demands to know why the location of the council meetings has changed. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> says that he is holding the meeting in the <en name='Tower of the Hand' type='other'>Tower of the Hand</en> to save time. When <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> complains that he would have to climb too many steps should he wish to sit in on a small council meeting, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> silently ascends the steps to stand next to the throne, silently glares down at <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, and then sardonically says he could arrange to have <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> carried. A disconcerted <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> changes the subject to <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en>; <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is surprised that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> even knows about the exiled princess. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> admits the reports are apparently true that the last <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> is not only alive, but has successfully hatched the first live dragons the world has seen in almost two centuries. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is puzzled at why <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> doesn't think they should do anything about her, but <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> reminds <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> that the last <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> dragons were stunted inbred creatures who weren't a threat to anyone, and <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> dragons are probably just curiosities at best, not grand weapons of war. Moreover, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> says that even if <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> dragons do turn out to be as strong as the dragons of centuries long ago, they are on the far side of the world and no threat to <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s rule. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> also warns his grandson that he should heed his advisor's council on matters he does not comprehend. When <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> protests that he hasn't been counseled on anything, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> says he is being advised at this very moment and says that he will inform <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> should he deem it necessary. Before taking his leave <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> smiles slightly with an even slighter bow leaving a browbeaten <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> squirming on the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. Their exchange leaves no doubt as to who is really ruling the kingdom.
At <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> speaks one last time to <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> before he leaves. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> remarks that he owes <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> a debt for both keeping him alive on their journey and for giving him a reason to live to rouse him from his suicidal depression after losing his hand. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> tells <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to repay his debt by keeping his pledge. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> promises that he will keep his word to return <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en>'s daughters to her.
The next day, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> leaves <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en> in the company of <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> (who is to accompany <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to continue treating his arm in the hopes of getting his <en name='Maester' type='other'>Maester</en>'s chain restored through <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin</en>'s influence- <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> jokes that his father will make <en name='Qyburn Grand Maester' type='other'>Qyburn Grand Maester</en> if he grows <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> a new hand) and a number of <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> soldiers under the command of <en name='Steelshanks' type='other'>Steelshanks</en>, one of <en name='Bolton' type='person'>Lord Bolton</en>'s captains. <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Lord Roose Bolton</en>, who is also about to depart <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en> for the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en>, under orders from <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>, requests that <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> pass on his regards to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>; <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> asks that <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> do the same for him with <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>, who has been left in charge of the castle in <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en>'s absence, can't resist poking fun at the departing <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and sneers that he will 'take good care' of <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>, though <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> doesn't rise to the bait.
When their party makes camp, as <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> checks <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s stump, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> questions how the former <en name='Maester' type='other'>Maester</en> lost his chain. <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> explains that he lost it for performing vivisections on the sick and dying in a bid to better understand illness. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is disgusted by this revelation, but <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> counters what he learned has saved numerous more lives and questions <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> on how many he has killed compared to how many he's saved. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> responds that he has probably killed thousands, but he saved half a million lives when he killed the <en name='Mad King' type='other'>Mad King</en> to save the population of <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, much to <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en>'s surprise.
<en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> then asks about <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>; <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> confirms that they sent a raven to her father, <en name='Selwyn Tarth' type='person'>Lord Selwyn Tarth</en>, and he offered a ransom of 300 <en name='Gold Dragons' type='other'>Gold Dragons</en> for his daughter's safe return. However, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> refused the offer; still under the misapprehension that <en name='Tarth' type='other'>Tarth</en> owns every sapphire mine in <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> is convinced <en name='Selwyn Tarth' type='person'>Lord Selwyn</en> is trying to cheat him. When <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> mentions that most of the men would rather get some meager entertainment out of killing <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> before they die in battle or winter, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, feeling guilty because his lie to protect <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> has invertantly placed her in greater danger, urges <en name='Steelshanks' type='other'>Steelshanks</en> to return to <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en>. Though the man initially refuses, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> uses the promise of a reward and the threat of <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en>'s retribution to convince him to go back.
Upon arriving at <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is shocked and furious to find <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> and his cronies have thrown <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> into a bear pit, facing an angry bear with only a wooden sword to defend herself, as they all mockingly sing <en name='The Bear' type='other'>The Bear</en> and the <en name='Maiden Fair' type='other'>Maiden Fair</en>. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> orders <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> to pull her out and offers to pay whatever ransom he wants, but <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> dismisses the offer, getting more satisfaction out of the spectacle of <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> being torn apart. In desperation, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> leaps into the pit to help her; before the bear can harm either of them, <en name='Steelshanks' type='other'>Steelshanks</en> shoots it with a crossbow, distracting the beast long enough for <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> to be pulled out of the pit. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> tries to stop them from leaving, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> angrily tells him that <en name='Bolton' type='person'>Lord Bolton</en> cares more about getting him back to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> alive than keeping one of his pet thugs happy, and backed up by <en name='Steelshanks' type='other'>Steelshanks</en> and his men, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> is unable to stop them. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> then departs <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en> with his escort and <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> in tow.
