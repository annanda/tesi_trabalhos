In the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin Lannister</en> meets with <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Lady Olenna Tyrell</en> to discuss having <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras</en> marry his daughter, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>. They trade barbs about <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s age, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s capability to have more children, and accusations of incest with <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, as well as <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>'s well-known homosexuality. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is adamant that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, whom he calls the <en name='Kingdom' type='other'>Kingdom</en>'s most beautiful woman, should marry <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>, the <en name='Kingdom' type='other'>Kingdom</en>'s most handsome and desired bachelor, but <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> blatantly refuses to consent, hinting that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is the result of incest. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> replies that if that is true, he has no right to the throne and the <en name='Tyrells' type='other'>Tyrells</en> just "threw a flower into the dirt". <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> says she will not risk "throwing another flower into the dirt" if <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> cannot bear heirs for the <en name='Tyrells' type='other'>Tyrells</en>. Realizing her unchanged position on the matter, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> threatens to make <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> a knight of the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en>, which would force <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> to give up his right to marriage and to inherit <en name='Highgarden' type='other'>Highgarden</en>. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> relents, and consents to the marriage of <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>.
In the gardens, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> tries to get closer to <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> by discussing their hopefully impending wedding. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> is clearly uncomfortable being so close to her, but brightens when discussing the lavish wedding he's had planned  -  although <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, for once, becomes suspicious when she realizes that <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> seems more excited by the food and the wedding joust than by her. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> quickly placates her with a compliment and then describes the wedding gown he's envisioned for her. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> says she's looking forward to seeing <en name='Highgarden' type='other'>Highgarden</en>, as she's only ever lived in <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> and can't wait to leave <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. In this, <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> finds unexpected common ground with her and agrees that the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en> is "the most terrible place there is".
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> observe the couple from <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s chambers overlooking the garden. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> sarcastically asks which of the four of them has it the worst. He then finally accuses his sister of trying to have him killed during the <en name='Battle of the Blackwater' type='place'>Battle of the Blackwater</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, tired of fighting him, remains quiet while he deduces that only two people can command the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> realizes that while <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> certainly has the authority to command a <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en>, she isn't stupid enough to command Ser <en name='Mandon' type='other'>Mandon</en> Moore to kill him in public. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> realizes that it was in fact <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> who ordered <en name='Mandon Moore' type='person'>Ser Mandon Moore</en> to kill him, because <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was the only one who stood up to him. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> tells him his life is not in danger from <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, as he dare not try anything like that now that <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is the <en name='Hand' type='other'>Hand</en>. They discuss about <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s possible return to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, with <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> wondering where he could possibly be. She asks <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> which one of them should be the one to break the news to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> decides he might as well dash <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s hopes sooner rather than later. He goes to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s chamber and asks for a private word, but <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> declines to dismiss <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> gives <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> a carefully coded apology for not telling her in private before breaking the news to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>.
Later on, <en name='Varys' type='person'>Lord Varys</en> finds <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Lord Petyr Baelish</en> in the throne room. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> and <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> discuss the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> and the pageantry and propaganda that creates nations and cements dynasties. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> asserts that he serves the realm, but <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> scoffs that "the realm" is an invention of <en name='Aegon the Conqueror' type='other'>Aegon the Conqueror</en>. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> tells <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> that he is aware of <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>' arrangement with <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en>, and that he has given her to "a friend" who is eager for a new experience. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> revels in the chaos that he has caused, likening chaos to a ladder (for those brave enough to climb) rather than a pit to be lost in, as <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> and everyone else sees it.
<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> kills <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en>
Elsewhere, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> weeps as <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>'s ship departs, both of her plans to leave <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> in tatters. Meanwhile, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> coldly contemplates <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en>'s quarrel-ridden corpse.
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, the hideout of the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en> without <en name='Banners' type='other'>Banners</en> outside of <en name='Hollow Hill' type='other'>Hollow Hill</en>, <en name='Anguy' type='other'>Anguy</en> trains <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> with a bow.     <en name='Anguy' type='other'>Anguy</en> teaching <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> how to shoot a bow better.   <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> spots someone behind her target, which is revealed to be <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> and a small group of <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>'s men. She speaks to <en name='Thoros' type='other'>Thoros</en> in <en name='High Valyrian' type='other'>High Valyrian</en>, demanding to know what became of his mission to convert <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en> to the worship of the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en>. He bluntly tells her he failed. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> is brought to the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en>'s hideout and is shocked when she learns of the six deaths of <en name='Beric Dondarrion' type='other'>Beric Dondarrion</en>, exclaiming that <en name='Thoros' type='other'>Thoros</en> should not have that kind of power. <en name='Thoros' type='other'>Thoros</en> counters that he has no power, he only asks for favors and the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> sees fit to grant them. The priestess seems troubled by his response (or perhaps by the fact that the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> looks favorably on causes other than her own). <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> says the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en> has someone the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> needs, and soon after has her men take <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> into her custody. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> protests, particularly when she sees that <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> has given the <en name='Brotherhood' type='other'>Brotherhood</en> two heavy sacks of gold in exchange. She confronts the red priestess, calling her a witch. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> ignores the barb and looks into <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>'s eyes. She sees many other eyes, of many other colors- eyes that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> will shut forever. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> abruptly tells her that they will meet again.
