<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> gains new responsibilities; <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is taken to the <en name='Fist of the First Men' type='place'>Fist of the First Men</en>; <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> meets with the slavers; <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> strikes a deal with his captors.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
In <en name='Astapor' type='other'>Astapor</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, accompanied by <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en> and Ser <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='other'>Barristan Selmy</en>, walks along a sea wall known as the "<en name='Walk of Punishment' type='other'>Walk of Punishment</en>." Here, any slave who showed insubordination of any type is strapped to a cross and left to die out in public, as a warning to all other slaves. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> offers a condemned man water, but he refuses to drink, saying he just wants to die quickly.
<en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> continue to disagree on whether or not <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> should purchase the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en>. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> insists that it is their only chance to get an army, but <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> believes this is not the honorable way, as slavery is illegal and abhorred in the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> claims that not only will the slave soldiers be treated better in her service, but innocent people will also be spared in war because the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> only do as they are ordered. They have no human or masculine urges in their bodies, and therefore will not kill civilians or rape innocent women, unlike most male soldiers who would succumb to those urges in the heat of battle. <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> retorts that when her older brother <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> led his army in the <en name='Battle of the Trident' type='other'>Battle of the Trident</en>, men fought and died for <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> because they believed in him, because they loved him - not because they were slave soldiers whose free will had been stripped away. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> responds that <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> indeed fought honorably and nobly, but that in the end <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> died. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> was born months after <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en> killed <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> at the <en name='Battle of the Trident' type='other'>Battle of the Trident</en>, and only knew her cruel and half-mad brother <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en>, so she asks <en name='Barristan' type='person'>Ser Barristan</en> if he knew <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en>. <en name='Selmy' type='other'>Selmy</en> was a member of the <en name='Targaryen Kingsguard' type='other'>Targaryen Kingsguard</en> and thus knew <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> well: he fought beside him and bled beside him at the <en name='Trident' type='other'>Trident</en>. <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> says that <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> was the finest man he ever met, the last dragon. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> grows quiet and says she wishes she'd known her older brother, but that <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> was not the last dragon (she is).
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> speaks with <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> mo <en name='Nakloz' type='other'>Nakloz</en>, as he shows her his slave soldiers, the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en>. He repeatedly insults and mocks <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> in his native tongue, leaving his slave translator <en name='Missandei of Naath' type='other'>Missandei of Naath</en> to clean up his crude and very insulting words into more respectful language. At one point, she pauses, wondering how to twist a particularly coarse insult from <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en>, and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> notices her reluctance to directly translate.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> says she will take all 8,000 <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> soldiers, including those in training. <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> laughs and retorts that she can barely afford 100 <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> surprises him by telling him she has dragons, and is willing to trade one. This offer stops <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en> in his tracks, yet <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> repeatedly affirms that he may only have one of her dragons. They strike a deal that she may have all the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> soldiers in exchange for her biggest dragon. Both <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Selmy' type='other'>Selmy</en> strongly object, and plead to <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> that while soldiers are valuable, it is dragons that will ultimately win her the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. She ignores them, and concludes the deal with <en name='Kraznys' type='other'>Kraznys</en>, and also demands <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> as a token of faith. Upon leaving the room, she scolds <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Selmy' type='other'>Selmy</en>, telling them that while she values their advice, they should never again question her in public.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> speaks with <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> and asks her if she has a family; she says no. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> tells her of the man who turned down her offer of water, and asks why he would simply say, "Let me die." <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> replies that in the afterlife, there is no master. Thus, the man would rather be dead than alive in the <en name='Slavers Bay' type='other'>Slavers Bay</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> proceeds to explain the dangers <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> will be facing in <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s service and asks if that will be a problem. <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> simply replies, "<en name='Vala' type='other'>Vala</en>r morghulis" ("all men must die"). <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> acknowledges the truth of the words, but quips, "We are not men."
<en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>
Horses' remains specially arranged by the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>
<en name='The Free Folk' type='other'>The Free Folk</en> army of <en name='King-Beyond-the-Wall' type='other'>King-Beyond-the-Wall</en>, <en name='Mance Rayder' type='other'>Mance Rayder</en>, including <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>, arrive at the <en name='Fist of the First Men' type='place'>Fist of the First Men</en>. They survey the bloody aftermath of assault on the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> by the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> and their army of undead wights. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> grimly remarks that the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> are "always the artists": the severed corpses of all of the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>'s horses have been carefully arranged into a large-scale, ceremonial spiral pattern. However, there is no sign of any human corpses - which <en name='Orell' type='other'>Orell</en> insists were there when he scouted ahead earlier by warging into his eagle, but have now vanished. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> says that there were three hundred men of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> at the <en name='Fist' type='other'>Fist</en>, and asks <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> if <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> could still be alive. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> says that with <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en>, it's possible he was able to escape, but that even if he did he and his men took quite a beating and are trapped miles away from the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> with the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> in close pursuit. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> warns <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that all of the missing corpses from the <en name='Fist' type='other'>Fist</en> are no longer his friends and brothers from the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, but have been resurrected as undead monsters who serve the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>.
<en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> orders <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> to take a force of twenty men to scale <en name='The Wall' type='other'>The Wall</en> to attack <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> from its exposed rear. The fortresses of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> were purposefully built to only defend from attack over the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, without defenses on their southern sides, so they wouldn't be a threat to the lords of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>'s plan is for <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en>'s small band to distract <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> by attacking their exposed southern side, at which point <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>'s main army will assault it from the north. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> will know that <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> is in position when his army makes a massive signal fire; <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> boasts that "I'm going to make the biggest fire the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> has ever seen!" <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> orders <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> to take <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> with him, as <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> knows the layout of <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, and it will prove a key test of his loyalty: if it turns out that he won't really betray the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> can easily throw him off the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> to his death.
Farther south, <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</en> leads the ragged survivors of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> expedition to <en name='Craster 's Keep' type='place'>Craster 's Keep</en>. <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> mocks the survivors of the <en name='Battle of the Fist of the First Men' type='other'>Battle of the Fist of the First Men</en> when they reach his <en name='Keep' type='other'>Keep</en>. He initially wants to refuse them shelter until he notices some of them stroking their weapons. Fearful that in desperation they might try to rush him, he relents. As the black brothers warm by his hearth, <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> mocks them. <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> insists that the black brothers should be grateful for his generosity, and that he is a "godly man" for helping them. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> tensely questions <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en>'s claim to be a godly man, but <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> insists that he is - to the "real gods," the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>, who consume entire armies on their way to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> but will spare <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> for his loyalty. He admits that he's feeding his pigs better than them - as pigs are valuable to him - and half-seriously suggests to his guests that they should eat the fat <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en>. He is also annoyed by <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en>'s loud wailing from birthing pains. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> leaves the main house to a birthing hut where he witnesses <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> giving birth with the aid of a few other women. To her horror, the baby is a boy. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> and <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> wordlessly realize that <en name='Craster' type='other'>Craster</en> will want to sacrifice him to the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>.
In the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>
<en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en> takes aim
At <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en> in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, the castle-seat of <en name='House Tully' type='house'>House Tully</en>, the funeral of the recently deceased <en name='Hoster Tully' type='person'>Lord Hoster Tully</en> is held on the banks of the <en name='Red Fork of the Trident River' type='other'>Red Fork of the Trident River</en>. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>King Robb Stark</en> has arrived with the main force of the <en name='Northern' type='other'>Northern</en> army, and he helps launch his maternal grandfather's funeral boat, along with <en name='Hoster Tully' type='person'>Hoster</en>'s younger brother <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en> "<en name='The Blackfish' type='other'>The Blackfish</en>" <en name='Tully' type='other'>Tully</en>. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s new wife <en name='Talisa' type='person'>Queen Talisa</en> look on with the assembled crowd of bannermen on the dock. <en name='Hoster Tully' type='person'>Hoster</en>'s youngest child, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s younger brother <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure Tully</en>, attempts to light the funeral boat on fire with a flaming arrow but fails three times. Just as the boat is about to disappear around a bend of the river, <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en> pushes his nephew out of the way and skillfully makes the shot. Knowing his accuracy was true and the shot would hit the boat, the <en name='Blackfish' type='other'>Blackfish</en> turns around to walk away (dismissively showing up <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> at the same time) as soon as he releases the arrow.
In <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s old chamber in the castle, she mourns with her uncle <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en> over her father's death. She asks him if he made peace with his older brother, with whom he had been fighting for the past thirty years. <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en> explains that he did: on his deathbed <en name='Hoster Tully' type='person'>Hoster</en> told him to stop calling himself "the <en name='Blackfish' type='other'>Blackfish</en>" as it was a stupid joke created over thirty years ago by <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en> to symbolize his bad relationship with his older brother, and it wasn't very funny to begin with. <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en> emotionally joked back to his dying brother that people had been calling him "<en name='Blackfish' type='other'>Blackfish</en>" for so long that they'd practically forgotten his real name. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> is happy that her uncle was able to make peace with her father before he passed, and is upset that she couldn't have been there. She reminisces that she watched from this window in her childhood whenever her father left, but now he won't be coming back. She tearfully wonders if her sons <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> similarly watched at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> for her return when she failed to arrive to save them. <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en> insists that neither he nor <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> have given up hope that the boys may be alive and in hiding, and urges her to be strong for <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is fascinated at <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en>'s ability to pleasure women.
<en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>King Robb</en>, <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en>, and <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> confer in <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en>'s meeting room. The war is not going well for them. <en name='The Lannisters' type='other'>The Lannisters</en> have defeated their enemies in the south and secured <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> from attack, as well as a marriage-alliance with <en name='House Tyrell' type='house'>House Tyrell</en>. They have superior numbers, wealth, and strategic position. <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> begins to speak of his recent victory at the <en name='Battle of Stone Mill' type='other'>Battle of Stone Mill</en>, which pushed the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> army under <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor Clegane</en> from the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and <en name='Brynden Tully' type='person'>Brynden</en>, however, are furious with <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en>: their grand strategy was to lure <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> and <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en>'s armies into the <en name='Westerlands' type='other'>Westerlands</en>, where they would be vulnerable, out of position, and unable to defend the capital against the <en name='Baratheons' type='other'>Baratheons</en>. <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en>'s role in this was to offer token defense as a feint to lure the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> back west across the <en name='Red Fork of the Trident' type='other'>Red Fork of the Trident</en>. Instead, by successfully attacking the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> at <en name='Stone Mill' type='other'>Stone Mill</en>, <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> kept them penned in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, and thus close enough to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> that <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> was able to rush to the defense of the city at the <en name='Battle of the Blackwater' type='place'>Battle of the Blackwater</en>. <en name='The Starks' type='other'>The Starks</en>' strategic position in the war has been ruined. <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> insists that they took valuable captives in the battle, <en name='Willem Lannister' type='person'>Willem</en> and <en name='Martyn Lannister' type='person'>Martyn Lannister</en>, but <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> angrily points out that he didn't stop fighting because his sisters are held captive. Considering that <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> didn't stop to negotiate when his own eldest son was captured, taking his younger nephews hostage will have no impact on the war. <en name='Edmure Tully' type='person'>Edmure</en> tries to at least point out that they lost only two hundred men at <en name='Stone Mill' type='other'>Stone Mill</en> and multiple <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> soldiers died for every man they lost, at which <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> cuts him off and shouts that they need their men more than <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> needs his (who already outnumber the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> significantly). At this point, the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> are in such a good strategic position that they can afford to be patient, and grind down <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s forces through simple attrition.
In the prison cells at <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en>, <en name='Talisa' type='person'>Queen Talisa</en> bandages the minor wounds of <en name='Willem Lannister' type='person'>Willem</en> and <en name='Martyn Lannister' type='person'>Martyn Lannister</en>. They are boys, only 14 and 15 years old. One of them asks if <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> really transforms into a wolf eats the flesh of his enemies. <en name='Talisa' type='other'>Talisa</en> says yes - but that he does not eat the flesh of children, except during the full moon. She asks a guard if it's currently a full moon, and reassures the now terrified child that he is safe.
Wolf Bread
At <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> calls the first meeting of the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> since he arrived in the city and assumed his position as <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en>. He has the meeting place changed to a room next to his own quarters in the <en name='Tower of the Hand' type='other'>Tower of the Hand</en>, asserting his dominance. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> arrives early and has all of the council members called in at once. All of the seats are on one side of the table, as a non-verbal test to see how each of them reacts around him. <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en> ambitiously pushes his way past everyone else to be the one who sits closest to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> rolls his eyes at <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>'s naked ambition and lets him pass, content to sit in the second-closest seat (for now). <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en>, who is most focused on survival by avoiding direct conflict, doesn't try to fight over a better seat with either of them, instead quietly taking the third seat away from <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s daughter <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> arrives to find the seats are all occupied, but not wanting to play that game and be relegated to a lowly position, she pulls up a chair so she is sitting at <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s right hand, opposite <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is the only one who even mildly stands up to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s posturing, by not even trying to sit closest to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>: instead he takes a new chair and makes a point of noisily dragging it across the ground until it is positioned at the exact opposite end of the table from his father.
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is upset with the three advisors, noting that between them, they possess the greatest number of spies in the world, yet none of them can locate his son <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, even though the entire <en name='Northern' type='other'>Northern</en> army has heard of his escape. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> asks what news there is of the war, and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> reports that <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> has taken the bulk of his army to <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en> for his grandfather's funeral, while leaving <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Lord Roose Bolton</en> in command of <en name='Harrenhal' type='place'>Harrenhal</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> makes a jab at <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>'s recent, titular promotion as <en name='Lord of Harrenhal' type='other'>Lord of Harrenhal</en>, noting that this makes <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> the current <en name='Lord of Harrenhal' type='other'>Lord of Harrenhal</en> in practice if not in name. However, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> says that <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> can keep it, because the title alone is enough to give <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> the social standing to be a suitor to <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lady Lysa Arryn</en>. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> states that they have known each other since childhood, and <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> has always adored him, and thus she will soon remarry to him. <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> notes that this will make <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> the acting <en name='Paramount of the Vale' type='person'>Lord Paramount of the Vale</en>, an even more important position (<en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> is even wearing a more expensive tunic than usual, laced with gold, to reflect his new status).
<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> is nearly raped by his torturer.
<en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> states that this will confirm that the <en name='Vale of Arryn' type='other'>Vale of Arryn</en>, which has been neutral in the war up to now, will not support <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>, who is increasingly being hemmed in by enemies (other marriage alliances, with <en name='House Tyrell of the Reach' type='house'>House Tyrell of the Reach</en> and <en name='House Martell of Dorne' type='house'>House Martell of Dorne</en>, combined with the crushing of the <en name='Baratheons' type='other'>Baratheons</en>, have in turn secured the rest of southern <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> under <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> control). <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> points out that if <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> departs for the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> that leaves a vacancy on the <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en>, and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> reveals that he has appointed <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> as the new <en name='Master of Coin' type='other'>Master of Coin</en> to replace him. While this may seem like giving <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> a position of relative power again, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> quickly points out that he has no prior experience in finance. With backhanded compliments, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> makes it clear that this promotion is really intended to give him an opportunity to make mistakes he will be blamed for.
After the meeting, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en>, and <en name='Bronn' type='person'>Ser Bronn</en> drop by <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>'s office in his brothel, where he keeps his ledgers. <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> loads them all into a cart as <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> flirts with him. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> says it was the safest place to keep such records, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> notes that his brothel hasn't been the safest place for bastards. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> says he hopes <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> does well in the position, as he owes him for securing the release of <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> (after <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> arrested her, mistaking her for <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>) but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says it was just a misunderstanding. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> then lead <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> into another room of the brothel, where <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the <en name='Battle of the Blackwater' type='place'>Battle of the Blackwater</en>: he has paid for <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> (who has never had sex with a woman) to enjoy the services of not one, but three prostitutes: <en name='Marei' type='other'>Marei</en>, <en name='Genna' type='other'>Genna</en>, and a contortionist named <en name='Kayla' type='other'>Kayla</en> (one of only four women in the world who can properly perform a "<en name='Meereenese Knot' type='other'>Meereenese Knot</en>").
Later, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is reading through the financial records, and explains to <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> that not all is as <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> would like the court to think. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> asks if he thinks <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> has been stealing to obtain the crown's money, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says the problem is more that he's been borrowing all of it. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere, but in reality the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> is heavily in debt, and <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks.
<en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> is beaten down as the captors prepare to rape her.
In particular, much of their debt is owed to the <en name='Iron Bank of Braavos' type='other'>Iron Bank of Braavos</en>, the largest bank in the <en name='Free Cities' type='place'>Free Cities</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> warns <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> that when debtors to the <en name='Iron Bank' type='other'>Iron Bank</en> cannot repay their loans, the <en name='Iron Bank' type='other'>Iron Bank</en> will first refuse to give out new loans, and ultimately support rebellions against them. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> fears that if they can't repay the debt, the <en name='Iron Bank' type='other'>Iron Bank</en> will eventually cut them off and start supporting <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en> or <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>. <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> then returns, with the money <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> gave him to pay the prostitutes. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is concerned that he lost heart and fled, but <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> innocently says he did "all sorts of things" with the prostitutes - they simply refused his offer of payment. <en name='Imp' type='other'>Imp</en>ressed that the women would provide their services for free, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> ask <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> to explain in detail what transpired, so they can take "copious notes."
At <en name='Dragonstone' type='place'>Dragonstone</en>, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>King Stannis Baratheon</en> speaks with <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> as she prepares to depart by boat. He is worried that his enemies think he is defeated and are laughing at him, and that now even she is abandoning him. She assures him that she still thinks he is the <en name=''s Chosen' type='person'>Lord 's Chosen</en>, but she must travel to the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en> to obtain something vital for his cause. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> says that he wants her, and that he wants <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> dead, and asks her to make "a son" again with him (like the <en name='Shadow-creature' type='other'>Shadow-creature</en> she conjured to assassinate <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>). <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> says that she cannot: creating a shadow-creature drains some of the fire of a man's life-force, and she fears that creating another would kill <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>. Over his protests, she explains that what she is seeking is even more powerful than a shadow-creature, and will change his fortunes in this war, but she needs a king's blood to do it. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> doesn't understand, but <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> implies that she needs to burn a human sacrifice who possesses a king's blood as an offering to the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en>. She can't kill <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> himself to achieve this, but as she points out, "There are others with your blood in their veins" - any of his brother <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s bastard children who managed to survive the purge.
At the <en name='Inn' type='other'>Inn</en> at the <en name='Crossroads' type='other'>Crossroads</en> in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en>, <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en>, and <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en> are still in the company of the <en name='Brotherhood Without Banners' type='other'>Brotherhood Without Banners</en>, who are preparing to depart. <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> has finished fixing a steel breastplate which <en name='Thoros' type='other'>Thoros</en> puts on, and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> asks why <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> is helping them. <en name='Thoros' type='other'>Thoros</en> says that they're not prisoners, it's just that the war-torn <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en> aren't a safe place for <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en>'s daughter. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> notices that they are loading <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> "<en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en>" <en name='Clegane' type='other'>Clegane</en> into a prisoner cart, so she walks over and angrily asks him if he remembers the last time he was here, but he simply says all poor inns look the same.
<en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> loses his sword-hand
As they get ready to leave, <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en> explains that he isn't going with them: he baked some bread for the innkeeper, and as he was a baker's apprentice when he lived in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, the innkeeper thought it was the best bread they'd ever had, and offered him a job. This life of fighting and travelling isn't really for him, plus <en name='Thoros' type='other'>Thoros</en> formally made a deal with the innkeeper to pay for the free meals they enjoyed with <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en>'s services. Before they go, he gives <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> a present he made for her: a loaf of bread shaped like a direwolf, though <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> implies the tail looks like a head. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is a bit brusque but the three wish each other well as they depart, and as they are riding away <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> starts eating the wolf-bread, and turns back to shout to <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en> that it is very good.
At an undisclosed location, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> escapes from the dungeon with the help of a young man, who gives him a horse and tells him to ride east. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> thanks him and says he'll make him a lord of the <en name='Iron Islands' type='other'>Iron Islands</en> for this, but the boy says that they aren't in the <en name='Iron Islands' type='other'>Iron Islands</en> now. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> is later hunted down by his captors in a prolonged chase on horseback through the woods. Ultimately his pursuers split into two groups and trap <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> between them, and he is knocked off his horse with a flail. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s captors pin him to the ground, and pull down his pants: the leader declares that he intends to rape <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> as punishment for trying to run away. However, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s unidentified savior returns and snipes all of the captors from afar using his bow, rescuing him at the last minute.
Somewhere else in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en> and <en name='Brienne of Tarth' type='other'>Brienne of Tarth</en> have been taken captive by <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> and a detachment of men from <en name='House Bolton' type='house'>House Bolton</en>. As they ride along, the men sing a rousing chorus of <en name='The Bear' type='other'>The Bear</en> and the <en name='Maiden Fair' type='other'>Maiden Fair</en>. Tied up back to back on one of the horses, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> warns <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> that when they make camp for the night, they will rape her, more than once, and that his honest advice is to give no resistance, and just think of <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>. They were only sent to capture <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, therefore <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> means nothing to them, so at the slightest provocation they will kill her without hesitation. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> says she will fight even if they kill her, and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> agrees that if he were a woman, he would fight to the death before being raped, too.
Later that night <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>'s men make camp, and do indeed drag <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang-rape her. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is disgusted by this pointless brutality, so he points out to <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> that <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of <en name='Selwyn of Tarth' type='person'>Lord Selwyn of Tarth</en>, the "<en name='Sapphire Isle' type='other'>Sapphire Isle</en>," and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires - provided that she is unharmed. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> agrees and calls his men back before they are able to rape <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>, and they tie her up to a tree again. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> tries to smooth-talk <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> once again with offers of how his father <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> will make him extravagantly rich if he lets <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> go. Tiring of <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> side, <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> decides to prove that <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s father will never deal with the likes of him. At first <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> has his men untie <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> on the pretext of letting him go, but then his men hold him down on a chopping block while <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> grabs a carving knife, threatening to stab <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> in the eye. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> reasons that maiming <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s son will be the ultimate proof that the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> would never deal with <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en>, much less bribe him. <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> says that <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s father can't help him now, and "this should help you remember!" - as he swings down the carving knife and hacks off <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s sword-hand. For half a second, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> stares at his severed right hand in shock, before what just happened can register in his mind and then he begins to scream in horror.
