In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
Underneath the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en>, <en name='Unella' type='person'>Septa Unella</en> enters <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Queen Margaery Tyrell</en>'s cell and leads her to a private meeting with the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en>. <en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> asks her what she would do if he allowed her to leave that day. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> replied that she wants to return to her family and her husband <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen Baratheon</en>. <en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> respects her love for her family but tells her that attachment leads to sin, citing his experience as a cobbler. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> manages to impress the <en name='Sparrow' type='other'>Sparrow</en> with her knowledge of <en name='The Book of the Stranger' type='other'>The Book of the Stranger</en>, which she admits <en name='Unella' type='person'>Septa Unella</en> had read at her. <en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> chuckles and agrees that <en name='Unella' type='other'>Unella</en> has a habit of reading at people instead of to them.
<en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> recounts how in his youth he was a womanizer and drunkard. He underwent a conversion experience the morning after an orgy, as his drunken guests lay naked all around his house. Tired of what he was now perceiving as a meaningless existence, the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> then turned his life around and became a devoted member of the <en name='Faith of the Seven' type='other'>Faith of the Seven</en>. He then left his job as a cobbler and devoted his life to the poor and destitute. Believing he has found a way to reach <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, the <en name='Sparrow' type='other'>Sparrow</en> allows her to visit her brother <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras Tyrell</en>.
<en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> remaining in her cell.
She finds a dejected <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> lying on the floor of his cell. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> has lost the will to continue resisting but <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> tells him to stay strong because he is the future of <en name='House Tyrell' type='house'>House Tyrell</en>. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> tells them that he only wants his imprisonment to end and pleads with her to help him. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> tells <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> that the <en name='Sparrow' type='other'>Sparrow</en> is trying to use them to break each other and again tells him to stay strong.
At the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei Lannister</en> walks in on <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> advising <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>King Tommen</en> to accommodate the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> and the <en name='Faith Militant' type='other'>Faith Militant</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> requests that <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> leave the room while she talks to her son alone under the pretext of meeting him for updates about the previous <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> meetings. During their conversation, <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> proposes that the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> not antagonize the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en> further in order to avoid endangering <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>'s life. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> then reminds her son about the humiliation that she endured at their hands and exploits <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>'s love for <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>. She convinces her son that the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> has no respect for kings, queens, and society. <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> then reveals a secret that the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> shared with him.
Armed with this new information, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> barges into a <en name='Small Council' type='other'>Small Council</en> meeting between <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan Lannister</en>, <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna Tyrell</en>, and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en>. While <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en> and <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> are initially hostile, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> convinces them to listen to her. She then informs the <en name='Council' type='other'>Council</en> that the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> has planned to make <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> do the walk of atonement. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> is horrified that the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en> plan to debase her granddaughter. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> then urges the <en name='Council' type='other'>Council</en> to allow the <en name='Tyrells' type='other'>Tyrells</en> to march their army into <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, crush the <en name='Faith Militant' type='other'>Faith Militant</en>, and bring <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> back to the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en> into <en name='Crown' type='other'>Crown</en> custody. <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en> says that <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> expressly forbid him to use the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> army he commands at the city to make a move against the <en name='Great Sept' type='other'>Great Sept</en>, for fear that the <en name='Faith Militant' type='other'>Faith Militant</en> will harm <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> in retaliation. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> suggests that <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> send <en name='House Tyrell' type='house'>House Tyrell</en>'s army to the city instead, and points out to his uncle that <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> only forbade his army from making a move - but he never expressly told him to prevent anyone else from trying, so <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en> wouldn't be breaking any commands if his forces simply stand down when the <en name='Tyrell' type='other'>Tyrell</en> army arrives. <en name='The Tyrell' type='person'>The Tyrell</en> army will surround the <en name='Great Sept' type='other'>Great Sept</en>, intimidating the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en> into releasing <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>, without any blood actually being shed - and by the time <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> finds out what they've done he will already be happy with the outcome. <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en>'s interest is now turned, but he still expresses reluctance should they fail. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is able to make him change his mind by exploiting his hatred towards the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en> for taking his last remaining son and heir <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel Lannister</en>. <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> agrees that blood will be shed no matter what they do at this point, so it's better if it's the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en>' blood and not theirs.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
At <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, <en name='Eddison Tollett' type='other'>Eddison Tollett</en> helps <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> pack up his things. <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> scolds <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> for leaving the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> after taking an oath, to which <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> replies that he gave his life for the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> and can't trust his brothers. At that moment, the horns sound for the arrival of travellers. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>, <en name='Brienne of Tarth' type='other'>Brienne of Tarth</en> and <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en> ride through the gates and dismount in the courtyard. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> rushes out and sees <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> for the first time since the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> left <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> for <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, and they embrace. Later that night, they converse and reminisce on their childhood. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> proposes they take <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> back from <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay Bolton</en> but <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> says he's done fighting, especially after hanging <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en>.
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> are reunited at the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>.
<en name='Davos Seaworth' type='other'>Davos Seaworth</en> asks whether <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> will stay at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> and she replies she will do as <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>, <en name='The Prince That Was Promised' type='other'>The Prince That Was Promised</en>, commands. <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> asks what happened to <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> and she replies he was defeated in battle. When he asks about <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en>, <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> is reluctant to speak. Their conversation is interrupted by <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>, who recognizes <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> and <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> as <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en> former entourage. Still bitter over the death of <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>King Renly Baratheon</en>, <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> warns <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> that she does not forget or forgive. She also tells them that she executed <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> after he admitted using blood magic to assassinate <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>.
Some time later, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> receives a letter from <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay Bolton</en> stating that he has <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon Stark</en> at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> and if <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is not returned, he will slaughter every <en name='Wildling' type='other'>Wildling</en> at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, let his men rape <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, and feed <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> to his dogs. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> says he has 2,000 able fighters, far less than the estimated 5,000 <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> has. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> says that they have to try to retake their home and rescue their brother and that the houses of the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> will unite behind <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> as the son of the true <en name='Warden of the North' type='other'>Warden of the North</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> resolves to take <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> down.
In the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>
<en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> practices his archery.
At <en name='Runestone' type='other'>Runestone</en>, <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin Arryn</en> trains at his archery in front of <en name='Yohn Royce' type='person'>Lord Yohn Royce</en>. <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en> arrives with a retinue of <en name='Arryn' type='other'>Arryn</en> guards and a pet falcon as a belated name-day gift. <en name='Royce' type='other'>Royce</en> reminds <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> that he told him that he was taking <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> with him to <en name='The Fingers' type='other'>The Fingers</en>, but he received word that she had been married to <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay Bolton</en>. <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> tells him that on the way to <en name='The Fingers' type='other'>The Fingers</en> they were set upon by a large force of <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> men. A confrontation ensues, in which <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> accuses <en name='Royce' type='other'>Royce</en> of giving away the information regarding the location of <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> to <en name='House Bolton' type='house'>House Bolton</en>. When <en name='Royce' type='other'>Royce</en> accuses <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> of slander, <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> reminds him that <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> is the <en name='Lord of the Vale' type='other'>Lord of the Vale</en>, and asks for his judgment. <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> then asks <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> if they should throw <en name='Royce' type='person'>Lord Royce</en> from the <en name='Moon Door' type='other'>Moon Door</en>, which prompts the surrounding knights, including those loyal to <en name='Royce' type='other'>Royce</en>, to muster themselves. <en name='Royce' type='other'>Royce</en> swears his loyalty to <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en>, and he is let off without punishment on <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>'s recommendation. <en name='Royce' type='other'>Royce</en> comes onto the dark realization that <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> has control over <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en>. <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> and <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> decide they have to muster the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> knights to march <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> and aid <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>.
In The <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
At <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> is brought before <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay Bolton</en>, who says that while her fellow captive <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon Stark</en> has value to <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, he is unsure of her worth. <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> denounces the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en>, saying that her servitude and loyalty to them were forced. She also attempts to seduce <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, climbing onto his lap and kissing him, all the while trying to get the knife he had been using to peel apples. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> seemingly falls for it, saying that it took much longer for him to get <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> over to his side but that <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> told him everything, including how <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> had seduced <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> in order to help <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> and <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en> escape <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> realizes that she has been lured into a trap, and tries to stab <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, only for him to slash her throat. She dies shortly thereafter.
In the <en name='Iron Islands' type='other'>Iron Islands</en>
<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> returns home.
<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> returns home to <en name='Pyke' type='other'>Pyke</en>, where he learns of the death of his father, <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon Greyjoy</en>. His sister, <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en>, is unhappy about his return and his refusal to leave the <en name='Dreadfort' type='other'>Dreadfort</en> when she made an attempt to rescue <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> from <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay Bolton</en>. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> explains that <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> "broke him into a thousand pieces," which <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> affirms "yes, he sent us one of those pieces" referring to the box containing <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s penis that she and <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon Greyjoy</en> received. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> then suspects that <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> has come back to declare himself <en name='King of the Iron Islands' type='other'>King of the Iron Islands</en>, but he insists that he does not want the crown, instead wishing for <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> to rule, with him helping her in any way that he can.
In <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> along with <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en>, <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en>, and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> meet with representatives of the <en name='Good Masters of Astapor' type='other'>Good Masters of Astapor</en>, the <en name='Wise Masters of Yunkai' type='other'>Wise Masters of Yunkai</en>, and the slave-trading city of <en name='Volantis' type='other'>Volantis</en>; who have arrived by sea. As the diplomatic mission enters the harbor, <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> advocates using military force. When <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> explains that he is able to empathize with slaves because he spent one day as a slave, <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> counters that he has not experienced slavery. The emissaries are <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s former slave master <en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en> zo <en name='Qaggaz' type='other'>Qaggaz</en>, the <en name='Yunkai'i Wise Master Razdal' type='other'>Yunkai'i Wise Master Razdal</en> mo <en name='Eraz' type='other'>Eraz</en> and the <en name='Volantene' type='other'>Volantene</en> triarch <en name='Belicho Paenymion' type='other'>Belicho Paenymion</en>.
<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> converge to prepare for their meeting.
In their meeting chambers, <en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en> marvels at how <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> went from being a nearly-worthless slave to the de facto ruler of <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>. The slave-trading cities offer to give <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> and her mercenaries a large pot of money if they sail away from <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>. When <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> defends <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s actions in liberating slaves, <en name='Razdal' type='other'>Razdal</en> contends that slavery has existed for centuries. After hearing their offer, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> proposes a counter-offer. He offers to give them a seven-year grace period to phase out slavery and to compensate slave owners, however they must end all backing for the <en name='Sons of the Harpy' type='other'>Sons of the Harpy</en> (regardless of whether they admit this backing or not).  He then cautions them that they will not get a better offer. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then gives them time to consider his offer, though <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> and <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> insist on abolishing slavery.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and his entourage are later confronted by a crowd of former slaves in the <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> throne room. A freedman demands to know when <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> will return while another is appalled at the idea of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> negotiating with slave traders. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> insists he is doing his best to rule the city in <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s absence. The freedmen do not trust <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, a foreigner and a newcomer, and look to <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> and <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> for reassurance. Despite their misgivings, they both publicly back <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s diplomacy in front of the freedmen. In private, <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> and <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> warn <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that the masters will outmaneuver him, despite his best efforts to do the same to them.
In <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en>
<en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en> and <en name='Daario Naharis' type='other'>Daario Naharis</en> approach the outskirts of <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en> and discard their weapons, as drawing a blade in the city is considered sacrilege. Within the city itself, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> run afoul of <en name='Akho' type='other'>Akho</en> and <en name='Iggo' type='other'>Iggo</en> who see through <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>'s claims to be a wine merchant. <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> takes care of <en name='Iggo' type='other'>Iggo</en> while <en name='Akho' type='other'>Akho</en> tackles <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>. The knight is nearly undone, but <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> saves him at the last minute with the stiletto he smuggled in. At <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>'s insistence, <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> smashes <en name='Aggo' type='other'>Aggo</en>'s skull with a rock so that no one will think he was killed with a bladed weapon.
<en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> proves to the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> who their true <en name='Khaleesi' type='other'>Khaleesi</en> is.
Meanwhile, the <en name='High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen' type='other'>High Priestess of the Dosh Khaleen</en> gives <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> a commentary on the other crones. Some of them hate <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, thinking the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> should not interbreed with other races, but the high priestess dismisses them, saying that the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> have always interbred and have never been concerned with blood purity. To illustrate her point, the high priestess indicates another of the khaleen, a <en name='Lhazareen' type='other'>Lhazareen</en> girl (<en name='Ornela' type='other'>Ornela</en>) taken from her village at the age of twelve. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> asks to relieve herself, and the high priestess sends <en name='Ornela' type='other'>Ornela</en> with her. As they walk, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> learns that <en name='Ornela' type='other'>Ornela</en>'s khal died when she was only sixteen. The pair are interrupted by <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en>, who take the <en name='Lhazareen' type='other'>Lhazareen</en> hostage. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, unsurprised to see them, cancels their plans for escape  -  they have a slim chance of leaving <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en>, let alone getting back to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>  -  and tells them that she has a plan of her own. She asks <en name='Ornela' type='other'>Ornela</en> if she is willing to help them, calling her a <en name='Khaleesi' type='other'>Khaleesi</en> (queen) instead of a khaleen (crone). The girl reluctantly agrees.
During the <en name='Khal' type='other'>Khal</en>ar vezhven, the khals argue about how to deal with <en name='Iggo' type='other'>Iggo</en> and <en name='Akho' type='other'>Akho</en>'s deaths; <en name='Moro' type='person'>Khal Moro</en> defuses the situation by reminding them that <en name='Ahko' type='other'>Ahko</en> was a member of his khalasar, and he does not care about finding the killer if he was stupid enough to get himself killed. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is then brought in by the two priestesses she befriended before. <en name='Moro' type='other'>Moro</en> insists that she join the dosh khaleen, but another khal expresses interest in making her his khaleesi, while another suggests giving her to the <en name='Wise Masters' type='other'>Wise Masters</en> in exchange for ten thousand horses. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> dismisses all of them; she claims that they are all petty and weak, and reminds them that <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> was willing to cross the "poison water" in "wooden horses" for his conquests.
<en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> bow down to their queen.
Stating that none of the khals is fit to lead the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> declares that she will lead them herself. After a pause, <en name='Moro' type='other'>Moro</en> and the khals burst into laughter. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> reminds them that her husband, in the same temple in which they all now sit, declared that he would lead a <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> army across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en> to retake the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> for his khaleesi and that all the khals have done since is to raid and plunder villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest. Disgusted with her insolence, <en name='Moro' type='other'>Moro</en> declares that she will be raped by each of the khals, then by all of their bloodriders, and then, if she is still alive, by their horses. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is unfazed by the threats, as she knocks down the braziers in the hut, setting everything aflame. The khals desperately attempt to escape the rapidly-spreading fire, only to find the temple's only door barred, the bodies of the two men guarding it lying dead outside.
As the flames climb higher, the dosh khaleen and khalasars gather in confusion. Eventually, the doors collapse and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> emerges, naked and unburned, with the entire leadership present at <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en> dead. Many of the assembled bow immediately, with the high priestess and the rest of the dosh khaleen following after a moment. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> and <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> move to the front of the crowd and bow last.
