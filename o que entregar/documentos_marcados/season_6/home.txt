Though <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> wants to stay, he is dragged out of the vision by the <en name='Three-Eyed Raven' type='other'>Three-Eyed Raven</en>, who warns him that it is dangerous to stay too long in such visions.

In the sept, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> talk about <en name='Myrcella Baratheon' type='person'>Myrcella</en> and <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Prince Trystane</en>. <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> believes that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is to blame for <en name='Trystane Martell' type='person'>Prince Trystane</en>'s death but tells <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> that he isn't upset with her. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> convinces <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> to go see his mother and apologize to her as the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> enters the sept. After <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> leaves, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> begins threatening the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> and asks him why <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is being punished for her sins, but he isn't, considering he murdered the king he vowed to protect. As <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is about to kill the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en>, the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> seems to be unafraid to die, which confuses <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>. <en name='The High Sparrow' type='other'>The High Sparrow</en> explains that if <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> chooses to kill him then many of the sparrows will die fighting him, but it wouldn't really matter since they have no names or individual power.

He regrets letting the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> lock her away and says that he should have torn the sept down with the <en name='High Sparrow' type='other'>High Sparrow</en> inside of it. He tells her that he needs her help in being a strong ruler. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> remains uncharacteristically silent throughout the exchange, but when <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> is done speaking, she embraces him.

He also suggests that dragons are intelligent enough to remember their friends, and that they will probably not harm <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> if they meet her again, since she spent so much time with them when they were little. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> go down below the pyramid, with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> advancing into the darkness alone.

To calm them, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> speaks gently, explaining that some say that dragons are more intelligent than humans, and tells about about a time when he was little and had asked his uncle for a dragon  -  not even a large one, just a little one like him. They all laughed, then <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s father told him dragons were extinct, and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says he cried himself to sleep that night. At this point, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is finally close enough to release the locking pin on the second dragon's collar. The other advances on him, then gingerly turns his head to the side so <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> can free him as well. The dragons retreat, and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> hastily returns to <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> instructs <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> to punch him if he ever suggests doing anything like that again.

In the woods, <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> fills <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> in on her encounter with <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, whilst <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> is reluctant to talk about her experiences under <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay Bolton</en>'s tyranny at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. She admits that she ought to have accepted her help sooner. Then <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>, wracked with guilt over his betrayal of the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> family, decides to leave the group and go home. He tells <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> that <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> and <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> will do a better job of looking after her, though he tearfully states that he would have gone with her all the way to <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> if necessary. He asks to take one of the horses with him, and the two share an embrace.
In the <en name='Iron Islands' type='other'>Iron Islands</en>
At <en name='Pyke' type='other'>Pyke</en>, it is a dark and stormy night. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara Greyjoy</en> reads a letter to <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>King Balon Greyjoy</en> about how <en name='Glovers' type='other'>Glovers</en> retook <en name='Deepwood Motte' type='other'>Deepwood Motte</en> and killed all of the <en name='Ironborn' type='other'>Ironborn</en> who held the castle. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> notes that their invasion is now a definite failure since <en name='Deepwood Motte' type='other'>Deepwood Motte</en> was the last stronghold that the <en name='Ironborn' type='other'>Ironborn</en> held in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>. <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> tells her that they will continue fighting, but <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> argues that invading the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> is pointless since they are unable to hold the strongholds they conquer against the mainland armies and the strongholds in the mainlands aren't really valuable to the <en name='Ironborn' type='other'>Ironborn</en> because they are so far away from the sea. <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> says that one of the reasons that the invasion wasn't successful was because <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> wasted men when she attempted to rescue <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>, which she says she will not apologize for. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> continues to try to convince <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> to end the rebellion, saying the only reason they were able to take strongholds in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> in the first place was because the <en name='Northerners' type='other'>Northerners</en> were in the south fighting a war, and now that war is over. She reminds <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> that the last time they provoked the <en name='Northerners' type='other'>Northerners</en> too far they were crushed and her two oldest brothers were killed. <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> tells her that when she rules she can be content with their current standing, but for now she needs to obey his commands or he will make another heir who will.
<en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> starts walking on the swinging rope bridge that separates two of the towers of <en name='Pyke' type='other'>Pyke</en>. Through the storm, he sees a man standing on the bridge who is blocking his way. He tells the man to get out of the way, but the man reveals himself to be <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en>'s younger brother, <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron Greyjoy</en>. <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> tells him that he's surprised that he's still alive, and <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> mocks the <en name='Drowned God' type='other'>Drowned God</en>, telling <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> that he is the <en name='Drowned God' type='other'>Drowned God</en>. <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> explains that he heard a rumor that <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> lost his senses during a storm and his crew had to tie him to the mast of the ship to prevent him from jumping overboard. <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> doesn't deny the rumor, and explains to <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> that he cut the tongues out of all of his crew members because he wanted silence. <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> then says that <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> is too old to rule and that he's been ruling long enough and it's someone else's turn. <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> tells <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> that he isn't a true <en name='Ironborn' type='other'>Ironborn</en> because he lost his wits during a thunderstorm and tries to stab him, but <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> throws him off the rope bridge to his death.
At <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en>'s funeral, <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> tells the priest, <en name='Aeron Greyjoy' type='person'>Aeron Greyjoy</en>, <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en>'s youngest brother, that she will find the person who did this and feed them to sharks while they're still alive. She swears to do this upon the <en name='Salt Throne' type='other'>Salt Throne</en> and <en name='Aeron Greyjoy' type='person'>Aeron</en> explains to her that she isn't the ruler yet, because the law says that the <en name='Kingsmoot' type='other'>Kingsmoot</en> chooses the next ruler. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> argues that her father wanted her to rule, but <en name='Aeron Greyjoy' type='person'>Aeron</en> says that he doesn't make the law.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
At <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, nightfall has arrived and the band of black brothers loyal to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> have not yet surrendered. When <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> refuses a final ultimatum from <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Ser Alliser Thorne</en>, the acting <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en> orders the door to be battered down with a sledgehammer. Before the mutineers can break in, however, <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> returns with <en name='Tormund Giantsbane' type='other'>Tormund Giantsbane</en> and an army of wildlings. Though <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> demands that the watchmen stand and fight, they are intimidated into surrender by the giant, <en name='Wun Wun' type='other'>Wun Wun</en>, enabling an almost bloodless takeover. One archer shoots an arrow into <en name='Wun Wun' type='other'>Wun Wun</en>'s back, which has no effect upon the giant other than to cause <en name='Wun Wun' type='other'>Wun Wun</en> to grab the archer off his perch and smash his skull against a wall. The watchmen, seeing this, quickly throw down their arms and surrender. No wildlings are hurt.
<en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en>, plus <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en> and the officers who mutinied alongside him, are led away to the <en name='Ice Cells' type='other'>Ice Cells</en>.

When he asks her if reviving <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is possible, she admits to having seen it done, but insists that she cannot do it, having lost faith in the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> due to the failure of her predictions regarding <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en> to come true. After <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> implores her simply to try, she agrees. After washing <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s wounds clean and burning his hair, she attempts to revive him using murmured <en name='High Valyrian' type='other'>High Valyrian</en> incantations, but it seems they have no effect. After a moment, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> leaves, and <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> offers a final "please" in the <en name='Common Tongue' type='other'>Common Tongue</en>, but leaves the room, despondent. <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> and finally <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> follow her a moment later. Once the room is empty however, <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en>, who had been sleeping underneath the table upon which <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> was lying, perks up, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> suddenly awakens, gasping for air.
