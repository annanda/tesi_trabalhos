He says he'll do whatever she asks and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> tells him to leave and never come back for her.

<en name='The Waif' type='other'>The Waif</en> continues to drill <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, mocking her high-born origins. <en name='Jaqen H'ghar' type='other'>Jaqen H'ghar</en> explains that the <en name='Faceless Men' type='other'>Faceless Men</en> were slaves in <en name='Valyria' type='other'>Valyria</en> before establishing the <en name='Free City of Braavos' type='other'>Free City of Braavos</en> and the <en name='House of Black' type='place'>House of Black</en> & <en name='White' type='other'>White</en>. <en name='Hand' type='other'>Hand</en>ing <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> a vial, <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> tells her an actress, <en name='Crane' type='person'>Lady Crane</en>, will be the next to receive the <en name='Many-Faced God' type='other'>Many-Faced God</en>'s "gift."

<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is unsure of what to do with <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>, having banished him twice, seeing him defiantly return twice, and him twice saving her life. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> finally confesses his love for <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, but also reveals his spreading greyscale infection, and says that this time, he needs to leave for good. He starts to leave and states his plan to take his own life well before the greyscale envelops him, but <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> tearfully commands him to find a cure and come back to her side when she conquers <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> then departs while <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> and <en name='Daario Naharis' type='other'>Daario Naharis</en> lead the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> horde back to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>.

While the rulers of <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> enjoy a tenuous peace, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> reminds them of the need to convince the <en name='Meereenese' type='other'>Meereenese</en> that everything has been done with <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s blessing, as the <en name='Masters' type='other'>Masters</en> could use <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>'s foreign status against them to reclaim <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en>. To that end, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> invites <en name='Kinvara' type='other'>Kinvara</en>, High <en name='Priestess' type='other'>Priestess</en> of the Red Temple of <en name='Volantis' type='other'>Volantis</en>, to negotiate spreading the word of <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s accomplishments. To <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s surprise, <en name='Kinvara' type='other'>Kinvara</en> appears to be highly accommodating in supporting <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s goals, as she firmly believes that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is <en name='The Prince That Was Promised' type='other'>The Prince That Was Promised</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> is more skeptical, being suspicious of any practitioners of magic, and points out that <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> had already declared <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en> to be the <en name='Prince' type='other'>Prince</en>, only for him to be defeated twice. <en name='Kinvara' type='other'>Kinvara</en> says that while the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> has a plan, the humans following him do occasionally make errors. She then unnerves <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> by revealing that she knows <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> was emasculated by a "second-rate sorcerer" and offers to repeat the words he heard in the flames, and identify who it was that spoke. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> is uncharacteristically unsettled by this revelation. <en name='Kinvara' type='other'>Kinvara</en> then assures <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that she will send the preachers and priests best suited to the task at hand.
In the <en name='Iron Islands' type='other'>Iron Islands</en>
As the <en name='Kingsmoot' type='other'>Kingsmoot</en> is held, <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara Greyjoy</en> is the first to lay claim to the <en name='Salt Throne' type='other'>Salt Throne</en>. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> argues that raiding the mainland is not enough for their people, and that they need to use military force to teach the mainlanders a lesson. An <en name='Ironborn' type='other'>Ironborn</en> man challenges <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en>'s candidacy on the grounds that she is a woman and points out that her brother <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> has returned. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> endorses his older sister and urges the gathering to do the same; stressing that she is a warrior, a reaver, and an <en name='Ironborn' type='other'>Ironborn</en>. Many shout for <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> to be their <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en>.
Before they can crown <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en>, <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron Greyjoy</en> joins the gathering to lay claim to the <en name='Salt Throne' type='other'>Salt Throne</en>. He openly mocks <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> for his military failures and emasculation before deriding <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> as a woman. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> in turn accuses <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> of killing their <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> and her father <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en>. To her surprise, <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> admits killing <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> but then defends his actions on the grounds that <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> was leading them to defeat in the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>. When <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> states that his only regret is not killing <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> years earlier, he is met by resounding cheers from the crowd. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> then counters that <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> had spent years gallivanting overseas while <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> was commanding <en name='Ironborn' type='other'>Ironborn</en> ships and men. <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en> then suggests building a massive fleet to attack and make their mark on <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>.
<en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron Greyjoy</en>, <en name='King of the Iron Islands' type='other'>King of the Iron Islands</en>.
In response, <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> announces that he also supports expanding the <en name='Ironborn' type='other'>Ironborn</en> fleet. Revealing a trick up his sleeve, he then proposes to marry <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> and then carry her army and dragons back to <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. <en name='The Ironborn' type='other'>The Ironborn</en> support <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en>'s plan and declare him king. <en name='The Drowned Men' type='other'>The Drowned Men</en> priest <en name='Aeron Greyjoy' type='person'>Aeron Greyjoy</en> then leads <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> down to the sea to be drowned and reborn, as is the custom. Knowing that <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> will kill them as soon as he is able, <en name='Yara Greyjoy' type='person'>Yara</en>, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>, and many of their loyalists flee the <en name='Iron Islands' type='other'>Iron Islands</en> during <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en>'s coronation, taking much of the <en name='Iron Fleet' type='other'>Iron Fleet</en> with them. After <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> revives himself, he is crowned by his brother <en name='Aeron Greyjoy' type='person'>Aeron</en>. After learning that his niece and nephew have fled with their best ships, <en name='Euron Greyjoy' type='person'>Euron</en> calls on his followers to build their own ships so that he may pursue the pair and kill them.
<en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>
<en name='The Three-eyed Raven' type='other'>The Three-eyed Raven</en>  shows <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> a vision of a heart tree amid spirals of standing stones in a lush green valley. His vision shows <en name='Leaf' type='other'>Leaf</en> and other <en name='Children of the Forest' type='other'>Children of the Forest</en> talking amongst themselves, then looking eagerly at a captive bound to the tree. <en name='Leaf' type='other'>Leaf</en> approaches and forces a <en name='Dragonglass' type='other'>Dragonglass</en> dagger into the captive's chest. The captive screams, but does not die, instead becoming the first <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en>.
<en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> immediately confronts <en name='Leaf' type='other'>Leaf</en> about creating the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> in the first place. <en name='Leaf' type='other'>Leaf</en> tries to explain that they were at war with the <en name='First Men' type='other'>First Men</en> and were desperate. Later, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> is the only one in the cave awake and is anxious to warg back into the <en name='Weirwood' type='other'>Weirwood</en> tree. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> wargs into the tree by himself and sees the <en name='Army of the Dead' type='other'>Army of the Dead</en>. He slowly walks through the army until he comes to a space occupied by four <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>, including the <en name='Night King' type='other'>Night King</en>.  As <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> becomes aware that the <en name='The Night King' type='other'>The Night King</en> and the dead are now able to see him, the <en name='Night King' type='other'>Night King</en> grabs his arm, branding him with an icy mark. He breaks out of the vision with a scream waking the others.  <en name='The Three-eyed Raven' type='other'>The Three-eyed Raven</en> tells <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> and <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> that the <en name='Night King' type='other'>Night King</en> is now able to locate <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and able to bypass the powerful magic keeping the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> and the wights out of the cave.  As a result, they must leave now and <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> must "become" the <en name='Three-eyed Raven' type='other'>Three-eyed Raven</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> asks whether he is ready, and the <en name='Raven' type='other'>Raven</en> says "No" at which point <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s eyes whiten as he enters another vision.
As <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> and <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> are preparing to leave they notice the air is so cold their breath is visible, indicating the arrival of the <en name='Army of the Dead' type='other'>Army of the Dead</en> outside of the cave.  <en name='The Night King' type='other'>The Night King</en> and three <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> start marching towards the cave. <en name='The Children of the Forest' type='other'>The Children of the Forest</en> try using magic projectiles to fend the <en name='Walkers' type='other'>Walkers</en> off, but are overwhelmed. They light a fire around the entrance which prevents the wights from entering but the <en name='Walkers' type='other'>Walkers</en> extinguish a pathway and walk through.  The wights end up climbing over the <en name='Weirwood' type='other'>Weirwood</en> and dropping through roots at the top of the cave. <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> desperately tries to get <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> out of the vision and attempts to get the frightened <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> to carry <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> away to no avail. Using a dragonglass-tipped spear, <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> kills the first <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> that enters, and fights alongside the remaining <en name='Children of the Forest' type='other'>Children of the Forest</en> to try to fend off the wights until <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> wakes up. <en name='Wights' type='other'>Wights</en> begin to swarm the cave, killing all of the <en name='Children of the Forest' type='other'>Children of the Forest</en> except for <en name='Leaf' type='other'>Leaf</en>, as <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> starts yelling at <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> to warg into <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>.
In the vision, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> is at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> watching <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en> say goodbye to his father, <en name='Rickard Stark' type='person'>Rickard Stark</en>, before being sent to the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> as a ward. While still in the vision, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> hears <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en>'s cries to warg into <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> and the <en name='Three-eyed Raven' type='other'>Three-eyed Raven</en> tells him to listen to her. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> wargs into both the present-day <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> in the cave <en name='AND Wylis' type='other'>AND Wylis</en>, the young version of <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> in his vision.
<en name='Wylis' type='other'>Wylis</en> seizing, as his words "hold the door" evolve into "<en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>".
<en name='The Hodor' type='other'>The Hodor</en> in the cave puts <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s body on a sled and starts hauling him down a tunnel leading out of the cave with <en name='Leaf' type='other'>Leaf</en> and <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en>, as <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s direwolf <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> is killed attacking the wights. As the wights are closing in on them, <en name='Leaf' type='other'>Leaf</en> sacrifices herself, using magic to cause a huge explosion, buying the other three enough time to get to a door at the end of the tunnel. While the <en name='Three-eyed Raven' type='other'>Three-eyed Raven</en> and <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> are still sharing a vision, the <en name='Night King' type='other'>Night King</en> kills the <en name='Three-Eyed Raven' type='other'>Three-Eyed Raven</en>, and his figure within <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s vision blows away as ashes and rags.
With some difficulty <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> pushes the door open and pulls <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> through, coming back to help <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> close the door just as the wights approach. <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> grabs <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s sled and tells <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> to bar the exit, shouting to "Hold the door!". Inside <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s vision, <en name='Wylis' type='other'>Wylis</en> notices <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, who links the present <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> to the past <en name='Wylis' type='other'>Wylis</en>. <en name='Wylis' type='other'>Wylis</en> begins to seize when he enters the mind of his future self. As <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> continues to yell "Hold the door!" to present-day <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>, within <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s vision <en name='Wylis' type='other'>Wylis</en> falls to the ground convulsing and starts repeating this same sentence in the midst of his seizure. Eventually, "hold the door" slurs into "<en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>," as his condition deteriorates and it becomes apparent this is the moment <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> lost the ability to say any other words, and his destiny was fixed.
Present-day <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> braces himself against the door long enough for <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> to disappear into the snow with <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s unconscious body on the sled. Inevitably, the wights break through parts of the wood and begin scratching and stabbing a visibly distressed <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>. With no possibility of escape, all that is shown at the end is young <en name='Wylis' type='other'>Wylis</en> in the past seizing and crying out "<en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>."
