Young <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and <en name='Melara' type='other'>Melara</en>, in the <en name='Prologue' type='other'>Prologue</en> flashback
A young <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei Lannister</en> and her wary tag-along <en name='Melara Hetherspoon' type='other'>Melara Hetherspoon</en> are creeping through the woods of the <en name='Westerlands' type='other'>Westerlands</en>. <en name='Melara' type='other'>Melara</en> doesn't want to continue, but young <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> eggs her on. They reach a hut within the woods, which belongs to a <en name='Woods' type='other'>Woods</en> witch named <en name='Maggy' type='other'>Maggy</en>. Unafraid, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> walks in first. Upon meeting this "witch," <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> demands to have her future read. <en name='Maggy' type='other'>Maggy</en> is hesitant at first, but after <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> threatens to have her eyes gouged out, the witch relents. She says she will need a drop of <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s blood, so <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> pricks her finger on a dagger. <en name='Maggy' type='other'>Maggy</en> tastes her blood and offers the young girl three questions. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s first question was if she will marry the prince. <en name='Maggy' type='other'>Maggy</en> says she will not marry the prince, though she will marry the king, and become queen. She then asks if she and the king will have children, and <en name='Maggy' type='other'>Maggy</en> tells her that the king will have twenty children, but she will have three: gold will be their crowns - and gold their burial shrouds (indicating that all three will predecease their mother). Finally, she tells <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> that her reign will not last: she will be queen, but eventually a younger and more beautiful queen is fated to take her place, along with everything she holds dear.

<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> kissing her deceased father <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>.
In the present, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> arrives at the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en> to pay respect to her deceased father <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>. Once inside the <en name='Sept' type='other'>Sept</en>, she chastises her brother <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> for freeing their brother <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and indirectly causing their father's death. At <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s wake, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is approached by <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel Lannister</en>. He has become a devout member of the <en name='Sparrows' type='other'>Sparrows</en>, a religious cult, and asks <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s forgiveness for their adulterous relationship, as well as getting her husband <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en> obscenely drunk on the day he died. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> denies any knowledge of her husband's murder, and shrugs off <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en>.

While in bed together, <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> and the male prostitute <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar</en> contemplate a birthmark on <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>'s thigh which looks a little like <en name='Dorne' type='place'>Dorne</en>. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> walks in on them, complains about his lack of discretion and sends <en name='Olyvar Frey' type='person'>Olyvar</en> away. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> retorts that since his sexuality is an open secret anyway, there isn't much point in discretion. He also opines that as <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is dead, no one will force <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> to marry him anymore. He points out how this will leave <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, free to harass <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> simply replies with "perhaps."

<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> arrives in <en name='Pentos' type='place'>Pentos</en>, with the aid of <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he and <en name='Illyrio Mopatis' type='other'>Illyrio Mopatis</en> had worked together in secret to restore <en name='House Targaryen' type='house'>House Targaryen</en> to the rule of <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>, but that their errors have left them in <en name='Pentos' type='place'>Pentos</en>, unable to return to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> has descended into bitterness and self-loathing, seemingly determined to drink himself to death, but <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> angrily snaps him out of his self pity, telling <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he still has talents that may yet be of use; talents that he could use to seat the right candidate on the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> states that <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> is mired in chaos and on the brink of ruin; the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en> requires a ruler, one stronger than <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> yet gentler than <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>, beloved by the people, able to please the common folk and keep the nobility in line. When <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> retorts that such a man does not exist, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> points out that he never said this ruler would be a man. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> offers <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> the choice of either drinking himself to death in <en name='Pentos' type='place'>Pentos</en>, or travelling with him to <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> to support <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en>. After a moment, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> agrees.

One of the <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en>, <en name='White Rat' type='other'>White Rat</en>, is seen walking into a brothel and pays a prostitute to lie with him and comfort him. He is subsequently murdered by a member of the <en name='Sons of the Harpy' type='other'>Sons of the Harpy</en>, a resistance group operating in <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>. Upon being presented with the murderer's mask (left at the scene), <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> orders <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> to find those responsible, and for the murdered soldier to be buried in the <en name='Temple of the Graces' type='other'>Temple of the Graces</en> as a statement.

In exchange, the <en name='Wise Masters' type='other'>Wise Masters</en> have asked that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> consent to the reopening of the fighting pits, an arena where slaves used to fight to the death. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> denies the request. Later, <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> convinces her to reconsider, as his youth fighting in the pits gave him the fighting skills necessary for him to join the <en name='Second Sons' type='other'>Second Sons</en>, where he met <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>. Upon hearing that <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> hasn't been seen in weeks, <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> muses on the irony of a dragon-queen with no dragons.

When she approaches them, they attempt to attack her, forcing her to briskly escape the room.

Though <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> told <en name='Royce' type='person'>Lord Royce</en> that he and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> would be traveling to the <en name='Fingers' type='other'>Fingers</en>, they instead head west. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> asks if they have anything to fear from <en name='Yohn' type='person'>Lord Yohn</en>; <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> explains that he doesn't trust the retainers and soldiers who saw them, and is taking <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> somewhere the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> will never find her.

He reminds her of the oath she swore to <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to find the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> girls, but she states that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> did not want her protection. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> also points out that <en name='Pod' type='other'>Pod</en> was not safe in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and now that they are far away from the capital, he is safe and they can go their separate ways. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s carriage passes them, <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> unaware of how close her goal is.

<en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>'s attempts at training <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en> are interrupted by <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en>, who has been sent to fetch <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> for an audience with <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>. On the ride to the top of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is discomfited by <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en>'s presence and questions. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> explains that he intends to retake the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> from <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Lord Roose Bolton</en>, but needs an army, and desires the <en name='Free Folk' type='other'>Free Folk</en> to fight for him. He wants <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to convince <en name='Mance Rayder' type='other'>Mance Rayder</en> to bend the knee and have the wildlings fight for him; in exchange, he would set them free and give them their own land within <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> relays this message to <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>, but he refuses to bend the knee; to do so would be to show unforgivable weakness in the eyes of his people. Because he will not fight for <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>, his punishment is death by being burned alive. On the night of his execution, <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> stands before <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>, and although he cannot bend the knee, he offers him luck in the wars to come. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> is led to the stake. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> lights the pyre, and <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> slowly begins to feel the agonizing pain of the fire. Unable to watch him suffer any longer, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> turns and storms off. Others turn away from the scene as well, including <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> and <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en>. Just as <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> begins to give in and start screaming, an arrow pierces his chest. It is shot by <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, giving the man he respected an easier death. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> dies before he feels the agony of the flames.
