<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> makes progress in her training. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> confronts an old friend. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> struggles. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> travels. He convinces the wildlings to fight with the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> but the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> surprise them.
In <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>
In the <en name='Throne' type='other'>Throne</en> Room, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> ponders on what to do with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>. She asks <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> why she shouldn't kill him, since the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> are enemies to her <en name='House' type='other'>House</en>. He claims to have killed both of his parents and by that he is an enemy to the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> as well. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> isn't convinced that killing one's own familiy is a good reputation for someone in her service. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> counters by wondering aloud if she at least is worth his service. Ordered to tell her why he has come to her from the other end of the world, he explains how he learned about her own story from rumours and from <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>. He says that she  -  a lost girl born in a storm, who with virtually no assistance managed to acquire a barbarian horde, an effective army, conquer three cities, break the slave trade and hatch three dragons  -  might be worth living for when he lost everything he had lived for until then. He adds that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> needs his advice despite having a powerful army and large dragons, as she lacks both political experience and practical knowledge of <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>.
She eventually agrees to spare his life, but asks what to do about <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en>. She seems poised to fulfil her promise of killing him if she saw him again, as it would not do at all for a queen not to keep her word. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> defends <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en>, commenting that he is clearly devoted to her and quite possibly in love with her, but also that he did not trust her enough to inform her of his mission to spy on her for <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> and that therefore he cannot be trusted to stand by her side. But, he argues, just as a queen should keep true to her oaths, she should also not kill those devoted to her.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> exiles <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> from the city. Contemplating his greyscale, <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> returns to <en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en> zo <en name='Qaggaz' type='other'>Qaggaz</en> and offers to fight for him. He promises to lead <en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en>'s team to the <en name='Great Pit' type='other'>Great Pit</en> and win the tournament for the <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en>  -  after that <en name='Yezzan' type='other'>Yezzan</en> can make a fortune selling <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> on the black market.
Later, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> sit in her solar and have a talk about ambitions. When <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> mentions what a horrible father <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> was, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> admits that she no longer has any illusions about her own father. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is curious about the circumstances of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s murder of <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>. He wryly promises that if she decides not to kill him then one day he will tell her, but on that day they will need a lot more wine than the large decanter they are drinking from.
They discuss the role of <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> in their stories and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> assures <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> he trusts him, and that he's probably the reason she wasn't killed years ago. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was convinced by <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> that she could be a ruler who deserves his support. When <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> asks how he can get her what she wants, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> nearly rolls his eyes at her desire for the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. He suggests that she might want to stay in <en name='Slaver 's Bay' type='place'>Slaver 's Bay</en> and build a new kingdom for herself in <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, complimenting her on reopening the fighting pits and her upcoming political marriage. She assures him that she will stay and help stabilize things, and make sure the slave trade stays broken, but <en name='Essos' type='other'>Essos</en> is not her "home." <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> counters that no one will support her in <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>, but <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> somewhat idealistically declares that the common people will support her. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> generously assumes that this will happen (which it generally doesn't), but then he reminds <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> that <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the <en name='Great Masters' type='other'>Great Masters</en> and the smallfolk, and extends this to <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> and its <en name='Great Houses' type='other'>Great Houses</en>. He notes that <en name='Houses Targaryen' type='person'>Houses Targaryen</en> and <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> are effectively dead due to the combined actions of their "two terrible fathers." Neither <en name='House Lannister' type='house'>House Lannister</en> nor <en name='House Baratheon of Dragonstone' type='house'>House Baratheon of Dragonstone</en> will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the <en name='Targaryens' type='other'>Targaryens</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says that leaves <en name='House Tyrell' type='house'>House Tyrell</en> who might be willing to switch sides due to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s recent schemes against them but that still isn't enough. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> stubbornly likens the <en name='Great Houses' type='other'>Great Houses</en>, including her own <en name='House Targaryen' type='house'>House Targaryen</en>, to the spokes on a wheel, one on top and then others, and on and on, crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> sarcastically warns that others have dreamed of stopping the wheel, but <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> clarifies that she plans to break it.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> decides <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> will remain as her advisor, but confiscates the wine, as a drunk is of no use to her.
In <en name='Braavos' type='place'>Braavos</en>
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> assumes the identity of <en name='Lanna' type='other'>Lanna</en>, a clam-seller, and shows <en name='Jaqen H'ghar' type='other'>Jaqen H'ghar</en> she can convincingly become a different person, developing an elaborate and very believable backstory. <en name='The Faceless Man' type='other'>The Faceless Man</en> sends her, as <en name='Lanna' type='other'>Lanna</en>, to the harbor where she observes someone referred to as "the thin man" refuse a contract to insure a man's boat, leaving the man in desperate circumstances. <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> explains the thin man's business is a sort of gamble yet he does not honor his agreements; when a ship captain dies at sea, he is supposed to make good on his promise and pay the family, but he often doesn't. <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> instructs her to kill him, and hands her a "gift" for the thin man  -  a vial of poison. The waif is skeptical of <en name='Arya/Lanna' type='other'>Arya/Lanna</en>'s success.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Unella' type='person'>Septa Unella</en> continues to urge an imprisoned <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> to confess in return for her freedom. She remains defiant, despite being obliged to drink water from the floor out of sheer thirst. <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> visits her in her cell, and informs her that her trial will begin soon for the crimes of fornication, treason, incest, and <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s murder, all of which <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> furiously dismisses as "lies." <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> tells her that <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> has summoned <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan Lannister</en> to serve as <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en>. <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en> has, at this point in time, already arrived, and he has refused to visit her in prison. <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> also tells her that <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> has become reclusive, refusing to see anyone and refusing to eat in his emotional state. Before leaving, he tells her "the work continues" on their secret project.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
A bitter and determined <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> confronts <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> about his latest betrayal. <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> apologetically affirms he was helping her and that there is no escaping <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>. He tells her that <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> tried to escape but <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> caught him and tortured him until there was no <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> left. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> coldly expresses approval and reminds <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> of the role he played in her family's downfall, and that if she could do to him what <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> did, she would. <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> shamefully admits he deserved his torture as he did terrible things, specifically killing "those boys." Enraged by his dismissive reference seemingly to her brothers as "those boys" rather than <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> vehemently demands to know why they should be dead while he still breathes the air, forcing <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> to finally admit that they were not in fact <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>, only two farm boys. Stunned by this admission, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s anger towards <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> cools but when she presses him as to where they might have gone, calling him <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> again, he breaks down and runs out the room, crying, "<en name='Not Theon' type='other'>Not Theon</en>! <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>!"
<en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> maintains that his army must wait inside <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, thus starving out <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en> forces, as <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> had enough supplies to last 6 months under siege. Such conditions would cause a mutiny in the ranks of the <en name='Baratheon' type='other'>Baratheon</en> force and break them down. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, on the other hand, has a plan to defeat <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> decisively and asks his father to lend him "just 20 good men."
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> continues to tend <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>'s wounds. <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en> enters with some food, having heard what happened. Once <en name='Gilly' type='other'>Gilly</en> leaves, <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en> expresses concern at joining forces with the wildlings, particularly <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en>, who led the raid in which his parents were killed. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> reassures <en name='Olly' type='other'>Olly</en> that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> nor <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> stands a chance against the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> explains this is a hard choice <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> had to make, however unpopular, and then tells him not to worry, as <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> always comes back.
At <en name='Hardhome' type='other'>Hardhome</en>
<en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> and <en name='Tormund Giantsbane' type='other'>Tormund Giantsbane</en>, along with other members of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> and the <en name='Free Folk' type='other'>Free Folk</en>, arrive at the wildling town <en name='Hardhome' type='other'>Hardhome</en> to convince the rest of the wildlings to join them in the upcoming war against the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> and their armies of <en name='Wights' type='other'>Wights</en>.
Insisting on never being an ally with a <en name='Crow' type='other'>Crow</en>, <en name='The Lord of Bones' type='other'>The Lord of Bones</en> insults <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> for being at the side of an enemy like <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> seizes the <en name='Lord' type='other'>Lord</en>'s staff and beats his former ally to death with it. The wildling elders decide to gather in the <en name='Townshall' type='other'>Townshall</en> to hear out <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s proposal; an alliance between the <en name='Free Folk' type='other'>Free Folk</en> and the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> in the face of their common enemy, the undead.
Having not seen <en name='Mance Rayder' type='other'>Mance Rayder</en> since he was taken prisoner at <en name='The Wall' type='other'>The Wall</en>, the <en name='Wildlings' type='other'>Wildlings</en> question his whereabouts. <en name='Snow' type='other'>Snow</en> reluctantly informs them that he is dead and that he shot him personally with an arrow. The group is infuriated, but as they move in to kill him, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> vouches for him, describing how <en name='Rayder' type='other'>Rayder</en> was about to be burned at the stake as a warning from <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>, and how <en name='Snow' type='other'>Snow</en> defied <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> by ending his life quickly instead of humiliating him and making him suffer in the flames. Some leaders are convinced, such as <en name='Karsi' type='other'>Karsi</en> and the giant <en name='Wun Wun' type='other'>Wun Wun</en>, but others like the <en name='Thenn' type='other'>Thenn</en> warrior <en name='Loboda' type='other'>Loboda</en> begin to leave. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> offers them the dragonglass daggers, telling them that his friend had killed a <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> with one. <en name='The Wildlings' type='other'>The Wildlings</en> still seem unconvinced.
While approximately five thousand <en name='Free Folk' type='other'>Free Folk</en> gather to set sail to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> starts gathering the dragonglass daggers in the tent. <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> approaches <en name='Wun Wun' type='other'>Wun Wun</en> who holds one of the daggers, examining it curiously. The giant appears unwilling to hand it over and asks <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> "The fuck you looking at?" in the giants' rudimentary form of the <en name='Old Tongue' type='other'>Old Tongue</en>. <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en> walks away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead. Suddenly, dogs begin barking and the sounds of a storm are heard. Recognizing the sign of approaching <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>, <en name='Loboda' type='other'>Loboda</en> orders the gates of <en name='Hardhome' type='other'>Hardhome</en> to be shut, abandoning many of the <en name='Free Folk' type='other'>Free Folk</en> on the other side to their fate. As the storm reaches the village, the screams of the people shut outside the walls of <en name='Hardhome' type='other'>Hardhome</en> quickly fall silent. A moment later, a large host of undead wights begin breaking through the gates and climbing over the walls. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en>, <en name='Loboda' type='other'>Loboda</en> and <en name='Karsi' type='other'>Karsi</en> fight alongside others to give as many people as possible an opportunity to make it to their ships. <en name='Eddison Tollett' type='other'>Eddison Tollett</en>, <en name='Wun Wun' type='other'>Wun Wun</en>, and others are trapped inside the townhall, which is set upon by wights and catches fire  -  in the confusion, the bag of dragonglass weapons is lost.
<en name='The Night King' type='other'>The Night King</en> raises the dead wildlings into wights.
On top of a hill overlooking <en name='Hardhome' type='other'>Hardhome</en>, several <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> mounted on undead horses observe the battle, including the <en name='Night King' type='other'>Night King</en>. Noticing them, and realizing the need for dragonglass, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and <en name='Loboda' type='other'>Loboda</en> go to the burning townhall, only to be confronted by a <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> warrior. While <en name='Loboda' type='other'>Loboda</en> faces the threat, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> goes for the dragonglass. <en name='Loboda' type='other'>Loboda</en> is quickly killed after his axe shatters immediately upon contacting the <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en>'s ice blade. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> just manages to grab a dragonglass dagger but is tossed aside by the <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> retrieves <en name='Longclaw' type='other'>Longclaw</en> and defends himself against the <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> and both combatants are astonished to see the <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> steel remain intact after colliding with the <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en>'s blade. Seizing the opportunity, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> strikes the <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en>, shattering his body into fragments of ice, confirming that <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> steel is just as lethal to them as dragonglass. <en name='The Night King' type='other'>The Night King</en>, watching the entire battle from a distance, seems at least mildly intrigued by this turn of events.
Meanwhile, <en name='Karsi' type='other'>Karsi</en> fights off multiple wights before being confronted by a pack of undead children. Frozen by the horror, she is unable to resist as she is mauled to death. <en name='The White Walkers' type='other'>The White Walkers</en> deploy another large host of wights, letting them hurl themselves over the cliffs above <en name='Hardhome' type='other'>Hardhome</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, <en name='Edd' type='other'>Edd</en>, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> and the remaining defenders flee for their lives. Shielded by <en name='Wun Wun' type='other'>Wun Wun</en>, who throws several wights off himself and wields a burning log as a club before walking into the sea with them, they manage to get to the last remaining boat and quickly row out to a safe distance. As <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and the others look on in horror, the <en name='Night King' type='other'>Night King</en> raises his arms triumphantly; all around it, the slain wildlings rise up as undead wights, including <en name='Karsi' type='other'>Karsi</en>. <en name='The Night King' type='other'>The Night King</en> and his army continue to stare in silence as they retreat.
