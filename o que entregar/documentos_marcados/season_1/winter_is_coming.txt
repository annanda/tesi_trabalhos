<en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert Baratheon</en> majestically arrives in <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, the home of his old and trusted friend, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en>, <en name='Warden of the North' type='other'>Warden of the North</en>, with an important offer.
On the eastern continent, the exiled <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Princess Daenerys Targaryen</en> marries <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en>, a warlord of the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> with tens of thousands of warriors at his command. Her brother, <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en>, callously plans to win <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s allegiance with the marriage, so that he may return home to <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> and reclaim the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>, which was seized by force from his father by <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>.
In the frozen lands, beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, the wildlings are on the move, to the alarm of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. But even farther north, something colder and darker is beginning to stir.
<en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>
Three rangers of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>: <en name='Waymar Royce' type='person'>Ser Waymar Royce</en>, <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en>, and <en name='Gared' type='other'>Gared</en> depart from the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> to investigate reports of wildlings in the <en name='Haunted Forest' type='other'>Haunted Forest</en> which lies to the north, <en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>. <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en>, the best scout in the group, discovers a number of wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground.
Wight of wildling girl.  He also finds a dead wildling girl pinned to a tree. He reports back to the others. <en name='Waymar' type='person'>Ser Waymar</en> overrides the older <en name='Gared' type='other'>Gared</en>'s advice that they return to <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> to report the situation to their superiors and instead insists on seeing the corpses for himself, to determine what killed them. When they reach the site, the bodies have disappeared. <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en> scouts around for clues, but <en name='Gared' type='other'>Gared</en> finds a bloody piece of clothing buried under the snow. Further investigations are curtailed when a tall, humanoid figure with glowing blue eyes, a <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en>, arrives and kills <en name='Waymar' type='person'>Ser Waymar</en> with ease. <en name='Gared' type='other'>Gared</en> attempts to escape but is caught and killed. <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en>, in extreme horror, sees the dead wildling girl from earlier now walking with blue eyes, and also witnesses <en name='Gared' type='other'>Gared</en>'s death, with the <en name='White Walker' type='other'>White Walker</en> tossing his severed head at <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en>'s feet.
In the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>
<en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en> draws his sword.
Some time later, <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en> has fled south of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> in terror, rather than return to warn <en name='Castle Black of the White Walker' type='other'>Castle Black of the White Walker</en> threat. He is apprehended by outriders loyal to <en name='House Stark' type='house'>House Stark</en>, the wardens of the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>, and is taken to <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard Stark</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en>, in the courtyard watching his son, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en> at archery training, decrees that as a deserter from the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>, <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en> is an oathbreaker and must die. <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en> accepts his fate, but tells <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> about the <en name='Walkers' type='other'>Walkers</en> first and asks that word be sent back to his mother. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> carries out the execution himself, using the ancestral <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> blade of their house, <en name='Ice' type='other'>Ice</en>. Two of <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s trueborn sons, 17-year-old <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and 10-year-old <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, accompany him to the execution along with his bastard son <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en>, his ward, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en>, the master-at-arms <en name='Rodrik Cassel' type='other'>Rodrik Cassel</en> and his leading guard <en name='Jory Cassel' type='other'>Jory Cassel</en>. Young <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> witnesses an execution for the first time without flinching, earning praise from <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> explains to <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> that the reason he was made to execute <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en> was because the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. When <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> asks his father about <en name='Will' type='other'>Will</en>'s talk of <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en>, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> dismisses it as a madman's ramblings, insisting that the <en name='Walkers' type='other'>Walkers</en> have been gone for centuries. The party sets out to return to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>.
<en name='The Starks' type='other'>The Starks</en> come across the <en name='Direwolves' type='other'>Direwolves</en>.
On the way back to the castle, the party finds a stag dead in the road, partially disemboweled. Looking for what killed it, they find a dead female direwolf, killed with a stag antler piece broken off in her throat. The female died after giving birth, and her five pups huddle by the corpse for warmth. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> advocates killing the pups, but <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> convinces his father that this is an omen: the direwolf is the symbol of <en name='House Stark' type='house'>House Stark</en>, and <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> has five trueborn children. With <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> looking on beseechingly, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> agrees that his children should have the pups, but only if they raise them themselves with no help from the servants. Just as the party leaves, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> finds a sixth pup, an albino runt of the litter. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> mockingly points out that this one belongs to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, the capital city of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>, the bells ring out to commemorate the death of <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Lord Jon Arryn</en>, the <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en>. As the <en name='Silent Sisters' type='other'>Silent Sisters</en> prepare his body for burial, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei Lannister</en> looks on. She is worried that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> discovered something he shouldn't have, and may have told someone. She confesses her fears to her twin brother, <en name='Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard' type='person'>Ser Jaime Lannister of the Kingsguard</en>, but he tells her not to worry, since if the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> knew the truth they'd be dead already. She tells him he should be the new <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en>, but he doesn't want the job. He considers it too much work. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> accuses him of taking nothing seriously.
A raven bears news of <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>'s death to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, where <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Lady Catelyn Stark</en> informs <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>. He is particularly stricken because <en name='Arryn' type='other'>Arryn</en> served as a father-figure to him, when he was fostered at the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>. She also tells him that <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert Baratheon</en> and much of the royal court rides for <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> realizes that <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> means to name him as the <en name='Hand' type='other'>Hand</en> to replace <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>. He ponders refusing, feeling his place is at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>.
Over the next few weeks the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> children grow used to their rapidly-growing direwolves: <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> names his <en name='Grey Wind' type='other'>Grey Wind</en>, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> calls hers <en name='Lady' type='other'>Lady</en>, and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> names hers <en name='Nymeria' type='other'>Nymeria</en> after a great warrior-queen. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> names his <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en>, for his white color and uncanny silence. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> calls his <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> and six-year-old <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en> names his wolf <en name='Shaggydog' type='other'>Shaggydog</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s mother catches him climbing on the rooftops of the castle, just as the royal party comes into view. He promises to stop, but his mother knows he is lying. <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> prepares for guests. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en> wants to make sure that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en>, a great reader, has enough candles, and the young men of the house get groomed, as they gossip about the queen, a reportedly great beauty.
<en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> gathers to greet the royal party.
All of <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> gathers in the courtyard as the royal party approaches. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is late and annoys <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> by not being silent and respectful when they arrive. <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> rides in with his knights, while <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei</en> is in a large wheelhouse. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> presents his household to <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> and <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> greet each other warmly, and then <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s deceased sister, <en name='Lyanna Mormont' type='person'>Lyanna</en>, much to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei</en>'s impatience. After <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> and <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> depart, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> sends <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to find their younger brother <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, who is a dwarf. "<en name='The Imp' type='other'>The Imp</en>" has found his way to the brothel in the town outside <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, where he enjoys the attentions of a prostitute named <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en>. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, a man of limited height but with immense appetites, that he will be needed at the feast that night. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> has hired three more prostitutes for <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, to hurry things along.
<en name='Lyanna Mormont' type='person'>Lyanna</en>'s statue in the crypts of <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>.
In the crypts <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> offers up his prayers at the tomb of <en name='Lyanna Stark' type='person'>Lyanna Stark</en>, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s younger sister, whom <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> was betrothed to before she was kidnapped by <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Prince Rhaegar Targaryen</en> and died shortly after being rescued. He tells <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> that in his dreams he kills <en name='Rhaegar Targaryen' type='person'>Rhaegar</en> every night anew. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> reminds him that <en name='House Targaryen' type='house'>House Targaryen</en> was destroyed, but <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> replies: "not all of them."
<en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> formally offers <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> the role of <en name='Hand' type='other'>Hand</en>, and <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> asks for time to consider. <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> agrees, but offers a sweetener: the hand of his son, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, in marriage to <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s daughter, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>. A great feast is held and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> exchange cordial words. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> seems more impressed by <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, thinking that she will be a great hit at court. Outside the feast, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> works at his sword practice, angry that <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> thought it would be inappropriate that a bastard should attend. His uncle <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen Stark</en>, <en name='First Ranger of the Night 's Watch' type='other'>First Ranger of the Night 's Watch</en>, arrives to join the feast, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> asks him to take him back to the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> with him. <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen</en> agrees to consider it. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> then arrives and talks to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, suggesting that he is too pricklish and quick to take offense when his illegitimacy is pointed out. He should take the insult and wear it like armor, so that no one can hurt him with it. When <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> angrily asks <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> what he knows about it, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> replies that "all dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> and <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> receive a letter in the night, delivered to <en name='Luwin' type='person'>Maester Luwin</en> by a messenger from the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>. The letter is from <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s sister, <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lady Lysa Arryn</en>, the widow of <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>. In the letter, <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> says that <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> was murdered by the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> and that they plan to conspire against <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>. <en name='Luwin' type='other'>Luwin</en> counsels that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> should accept <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s offer to be <en name='Hand' type='other'>Hand</en>, so he can investigate the truth of the matter and protect the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>, while he would prefer to stay at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, agrees with <en name='Luwin' type='other'>Luwin</en> and accepts the offer.
The next morning <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> and <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> go hunting, leaving the castle largely empty. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> indulges in some climbing but, while climbing a broken tower, he hears someone moaning. He peers through a window and finds the queen and her brother engaged in a sexual act. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> spots him and warns <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, who grabs <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> looks out the window to make sure nobody else is watching and only sees <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en>. He turns to <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and asks how old he is. When <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> replies "ten," <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> remarks with a sigh, "The things I do for love." With that, he pushes <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> out of the window.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
In the Free City of <en name='Pentos' type='place'>Pentos</en>, across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>, <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> enjoy the hospitality of <en name='Magister Illyrio Mopatis' type='other'>Magister Illyrio Mopatis</en>. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> has arranged to wed his sister <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> (also called "<en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en>") to <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en>, the warlord of a <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> khalasar of forty thousand warriors. In return, <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> will give <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> the army he needs to reclaim the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> prepares <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> for meeting the <en name='Khal' type='other'>Khal</en>. He tells her what a beautiful young woman she has turned into, and slips off her dress and fondles her breast. She is silent and looks away as if pretending it isn't happening. She steps into a hot bath that has just been poured. This greatly distresses her maid who believes the water will scald her. However, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> seems not to notice it and appears to be unharmed.
<en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> arrives in <en name='Pentos' type='place'>Pentos</en> and approves of <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>.
<en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en> and <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> discuss the quest to sail back to <en name='Westoros' type='other'>Westoros</en>, and <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> inquirers when the wedding will take place. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is not pleased with the arrangement and blurts out that she does not want to marry <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> insists that she will, because in return <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> will give him the army he needs to retake their father's throne from <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert Baratheon</en>. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> adds that he would let her be raped by all forty thousand of <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s men and their horses if it meant getting his throne back. A short time later, <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> arrives at <en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en>'s estate. After taking a glance at <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> rides away without having to dismount from his horse. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> is concerned, but <en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en> assures him that, if he did not approve of <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, they would have known.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> in her wedding dress
Later, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> marries <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> and a great celebration is held. Several people die in impromptu duels, which <en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en> says is a good sign: a <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair. The bride and groom receive many gifts, but for <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en>, two are particularly interesting. The first is a box containing three beautiful stones. According to <en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en>, these are dragon eggs from the <en name='Shadow Lands' type='other'>Shadow Lands</en> beyond <en name='Asshai' type='other'>Asshai</en> that have turned to stone with the passing of time. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> appears to feel some connection with the eggs, but brushes it off for the time being. The second is a selection of books containing stories and songs from the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>, given by <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en>, an exiled knight of <en name='House Mormont' type='house'>House Mormont</en>. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> swears fealty to <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> as <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> and offers him his support and advice, which is accepted. For his gift, <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> gives <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> a beautiful white stallion. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> asks his sister to make <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> happy. <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> and <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> ride down to the shore and consummate their marriage on the beach at sunset. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is visibly upset and terrified.
