<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s predicament becomes common knowledge in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, making life difficult for <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en>. <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s position is already precarious due to a disagreement with <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert Baratheon</en> over plans to assassinate <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> before she can rally the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> to invade <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. In the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> is shocked by her sister <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en>'s paranoia and distrust.
In the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> and his escorts in the hills of the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> has his blindfold removed and finds that their party - augmented by several knights and the sellsword <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> from the <en name='Crossroads Inn' type='other'>Crossroads Inn</en> - is on the <en name='Eastern Road' type='other'>Eastern Road</en> en route to the <en name='Vale of Arryn' type='other'>Vale of Arryn</en>. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> notes that she said they were riding for <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> often and loudly. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> congratulates her on her cunning, while pointing out that his father will give out a handsome reward for his safe return (a point that clearly piques <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>'s interest). He also says that <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lady Lysa Arryn</en> has gone mad since her husband's death and will try to kill him in the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> also protests his innocence in the attempt on <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s life and points out he'd have to be an idiot to give the assassin his own blade. Before <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> can answer, the party comes under attack from one of the hill tribes. Despite taking several losses, the party is able to drive off the attackers. Despite having the opportunity to escape, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> fights, killing his first man during the skirmish, and in doing so saves <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s life. Afterwards, they resume their trek to the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> in the <en name='Eyrie 's High Hall' type='other'>Eyrie 's High Hall</en>.
In the High Hall of the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>, <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lady Lysa Arryn</en> holds court on behalf of her young son, <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en>. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> is furious that <en name='Cat' type='other'>Cat</en> has endangered them all by bringing <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> points out that if he is harmed, there will be war with <en name='House Lannister' type='house'>House Lannister</en>, but <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> is unconcerned about his threats, as the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> is strongly-defended and the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en> is impregnable. She orders him sent to the sky cells, three-sided cells with the fourth open to a sheer drop down the mountainside, forcing <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to huddle in a corner and try not to roll out to his death in his sleep.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
In <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> is angry about his mother's absence. <en name='Luwin' type='person'>Maester Luwin</en> tries to set his mind at rest about the matter, to no avail. However, when <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery, <en name='Luwin' type='other'>Luwin</en> suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow, of the kind used in mounted combat by the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en>, a notion which pleases <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>.
<en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Luwin' type='person'>Maester Luwin</en> discuss geography.
Elsewhere in the castle, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> enjoys the attentions of his favorite whore, <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en>, but becomes annoyed when she compares his prowess unfavorably to that of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en>.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard Stark</en> arrives at the tourney ground to speak to <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Lord Commander Barristan Selmy</en> about the death of <en name='Hugh of the Vale' type='person'>Ser Hugh of the Vale</en>. <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> notes that he had no family or friends so he stood the knight's vigil himself for <en name='Hugh' type='person'>Ser Hugh</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> is suspicious of <en name='Hugh' type='person'>Ser Hugh</en>'s death, wanting to know how he could afford a new set of armor so soon after being made a knight. <en name='Barristan' type='other'>Barristan</en> reflects on the irony of them being on opposite sides of the war during <en name='Robert 's Rebellion' type='other'>Robert 's Rebellion</en> and now they are working together.
<en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Ser Barristan Selmy</en> and <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard Stark</en> discuss the death of <en name='Hugh' type='person'>Ser Hugh</en>.
He also tells <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> that <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> is planning to joust during the day's activities. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> finds <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> tormenting his squire, <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel Lannister</en>, finally sending him off on a snipe hunt in amused disgust. <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> is adamant about fighting in the joust but <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> tells him that he is too fat for his armor and the other knights would let him win. <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> is forced to admit that he's right but they can at least watch the joust from the stands.
The first tilt of the day is between the fearsome <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor Clegane</en>, the <en name='Mountain' type='other'>Mountain</en>, and the popular 'Knight of the <en name='Flowers' type='other'>Flowers</en>', <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras Tyrell</en>. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> gives a beautiful flower to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>, while <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> and <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Lord Renly</en> make a wager on who will win with <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> betting on <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> is riding a mare that is in-heat, which confuses the <en name='Mountain' type='other'>Mountain</en>'s horse, causing him to throw his rider.
<en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert Baratheon</en> is dismayed to find he no longer fits his armor.
Enraged at having lost, <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en> first decapitates his horse and then attacks <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras</en>. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> comes to <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>' defense, preventing his brother from killing him. They exchange several blows, until <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> orders them to cease. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> immediately bows to the king, while <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en> storms off the field. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras</en> declares <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> the victor of the match to the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>'s discomfort.
In the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, <en name='Varys' type='person'>Lord Varys</en> meets with <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> tells him that the king is a fool and will soon be dead unless <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> can save him. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> wants to know why <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> is telling him this now. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> tells him he had to be sure <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> could be trusted.
He calls <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> an honorable and true man, maybe the only one in the city. He also confirms that <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> was assassinated with a poison called the <en name='Tears of Lys' type='other'>Tears of Lys</en> because he "started asking questions". <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is chasing cats in accordance with her sword training. She chases one into the dungeons under the castle, where she finds the great dragon skulls of the <en name='Targaryens' type='other'>Targaryens</en> in storage. She hears two men - <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> and <en name='Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos' type='other'>Magister Illyrio Mopatis of Pentos</en> - talking. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> says that events have been set in motion and the lion and the wolf will soon be at each other's throats. War is almost upon the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>, as they planned, but it has come too soon. <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> will not invade <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> until his son is born and pronounced healthy, which is still many months away. <en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en> suggests assassinating <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> to forestall the war, but <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> refuses.
<en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en>, <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor</en> and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras</en> at the tournament.
Afterwards, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> finds <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> in the <en name='Great Hall' type='other'>Great Hall</en> staring at the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> reveals that he knows about <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>'s assistance in <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s investigation of <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>'s death and reminds <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> of the consequences that may befall him should the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> discover his involvement. In response, <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> reveals that he already knows about <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> having met with both <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> and <en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en> just earlier that day, implying he knows of <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>' allegiances across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>. Their conversation is interrupted by <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>, who informs them that <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> will be joining them at their small council meeting.
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> escapes from the dungeon and tries to warn her father about what she overheard but she gets the words muddled up. They are interrupted by <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en>, who has ridden non-stop from the <en name='Crossroads Inn' type='other'>Crossroads Inn</en> to bring <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> forewarning of <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s arrest of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> keeps the information to himself, while <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> asks <en name='Jory Cassel' type='other'>Jory Cassel</en> about the state of her father's household guard. <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en> tells her she does not have to worry about her father's safety.
At the meeting of the small council, <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> tells <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys Targaryen</en> is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. He wants <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, the unborn child, and <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> dead as soon as possible.
<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> secretly meets <en name='Illyrio' type='other'>Illyrio</en> under the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> states that this act would be dishonorable, cowardly, and beneath their dignity. The other members of the council - <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en>, <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>, <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> - all concur that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> must die for the good of the realm. <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> orders <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> to enact the order. He refuses and resigns as the <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en>, to <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s utter disbelief and fury.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> orders his household to begin packing. As <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> is packing, <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> arrives and offers to take <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> to the last place <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> went before he "fell ill". <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> agrees.
<en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras</en> and <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Lord Renly</en>, who are lovers, meet in a bedchamber. <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> complains as <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> is organizing a hunt in the <en name='Kingswood' type='other'>Kingswood</en>, which will no doubt involve traipsing around the forest for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> urges <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> to claim the crown himself, offering him the allegiance of his rich and powerful family. <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> dismisses the notion, since he is fourth in line to the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> points out that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is a monster, that <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> is only eight and laughs at the notion of <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> and <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en>'s other brother, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Lord Stannis</en>, ever becoming king, as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster. He also asserts that the people love <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> and want to serve him because he is kind and doesn't revel in violence as his brothers do.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei</en> and <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> share a rare drink and discussion about the <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> threat. Surprisingly, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> takes <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s side, pointing out that the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> cannot cross the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en> as they have no ships.
<en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras</en> urges <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> to consider his place in the line of succession.
<en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> agrees, but if they land and the knights of <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> take shelter behind their castle walls, the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the smallfolk accept <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> as their king regardless. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> suggests that the unified armies of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en> could defeat them but <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> says she underestimates the skill and ability of one army with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. Their discussion moves to <en name='Lyanna Stark' type='person'>Lyanna Stark</en>, which surprises <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>, as in seventeen years <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> has never asked about her. He tells her that <en name='Lyanna Mormont' type='person'>Lyanna</en>'s death left in him a void that seven kingdoms could not fill. He also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the hold <en name='Lyanna Mormont' type='person'>Lyanna</en>'s memory has on him, and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> says that she felt something for <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> once, even after they lost their first boy, for quite a while. She asks <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers "No".
<en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> brings <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> to the last place <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> went before falling ill, which is one of <en name='Littefinger' type='other'>Littefinger</en>'s brothels. There <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> meets another one of <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s bastards, this time a girl, and her mother, a blond whore named <en name='Mhaegen' type='other'>Mhaegen</en>. <en name='Mhaegen' type='other'>Mhaegen</en> remarks that her child has <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s nose and "black" hair. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> asks <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> why <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> was searching for <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s bastards but he says he doesn't know, offering the half-hearted guess that maybe <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> suddenly took paternal interest in them. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> looks skeptical of that reason.
Leaving the brothel, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>, <en name='Jory Cassel' type='other'>Jory Cassel</en>, and the two guards that accompanied them are confronted by a large group of <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guardsmen led by <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Ser Jaime Lannister</en>. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> has heard of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s arrest and demands an explanation. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> says that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was arrested on his orders.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> is stabbed through the leg by a <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guardsman.
<en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> threatens to kill <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> but <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> points out that if he does, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> will die as well. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> acknowledges that this is true, so he says he will settle for killing <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s men instead. There is a brief engagement in which <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s two guards, <en name='Heward' type='other'>Heward</en> and <en name='Wyl' type='other'>Wyl</en>, are killed by <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> spearmen. In response, <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en> and <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en> fight and kill five of the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> soldiers. <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en> engages <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> but is quickly killed when <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> stabs him through the eye with a dagger. Furious, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> crosses swords with <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is shocked and then exhilarated when the older <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en> is not as easily defeated as he expected. However, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> gradually starts to grow worried as <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s high level of skill becomes apparent. Just as they are ready to clash again, a <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guardsman steps in and stabs <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> through the leg with a spear, disabling him. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman. He departs, telling <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> he wants his brother back.
