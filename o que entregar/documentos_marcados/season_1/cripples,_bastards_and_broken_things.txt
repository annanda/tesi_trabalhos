<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> stops at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> on his way back to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and gets a frosty reception from <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>, despite an act of kindness for <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>. <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> joins the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> becomes his friend and protector. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> arrives at <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en> and finally stands up to <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en>. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> continues to investigate the death of <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>. <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert Baratheon</en> hosts a grand tourney for <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s investiture as <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en>, to <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s discomfort. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and <en name='Rodrik Cassel' type='person'>Ser Rodrik Cassel</en> stop at the <en name='Crossroads Inn' type='other'>Crossroads Inn</en>.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> speaks with <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>.  In <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en> has a nightmare in which he sees a three-eyed raven, sitting on one of the stone direwolves outside the doorway to the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> crypts. He wakes up to find his direwolf <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> by his side. <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> summons <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>, the castle's dim-witted stableboy, who can only say the word "<en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>", to help carry <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> down to the great hall, where <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en> is hosting a meeting with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> and <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en>, both traveling down from the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> to <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> together. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> very pointedly offers hospitality to any man of the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>, silently letting <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> know he is not invited to stay at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>.
When <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> arrives, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> sympathizes with <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> for being a cripple, which annoys <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, as does asking him if he likes to ride, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> simply says it is the truth, no less so for being a hard truth. He gives the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> the design of a saddle which will allow <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> to ride even in his current state. He does it to repay <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s half-brother's friendship and because he has a weakness for, "<en name='Cripples' type='other'>Cripples</en>, bastards and broken things." Due to this kindness, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> says he can stay, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says he would prefer the brothel in town. While preparing to leave the castle, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> comes to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and rather condescendingly sends him off, recommending the prostitute <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en> at the brothel. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> asks <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> why <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Lady Catelyn</en> was not present to receive him and concludes that <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> is not in <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. He also taunts <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> about how the son of the ferocious <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon Greyjoy</en> has been reduced to playing lackey in <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> to his captors, which infuriates <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> and gives him a coin, assuming that he has not already had sex with <en name='Ros' type='other'>Ros</en>.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en> joins the new recruits at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>.
At <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, a new recruit for the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> has arrived: <en name='Samwell Tarly' type='other'>Samwell Tarly</en>, the son of the famous <en name='Randyll Tarly' type='person'>Lord Randyll Tarly</en>. <en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en> is fat, soft and pampered, and in his first practice fight does dismally. <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Ser Alliser Thorne</en> has no time for his weakness. He directs the other recruits to attack 'Ser <en name='Piggy' type='other'>Piggy</en>', but <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> finds this cruel and unfair, and takes pity on <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> and fends off the attackers. <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> tries to turn it into a game, ordering three trainees take on <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>'s protector (taunting <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that he has found a new <en name='Lady' type='other'>Lady</en> love), but <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> nevertheless fends them all off. <en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en> is naive and self-deprecating, claiming to be a coward and craven, to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s astonishment. No one admits to being a coward, and <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> says that they shouldn't even be seen talking to him.
<en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> joins <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> on the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> for sentry duty, even though he says his eyesight is weak, he is afraid of heights, and can't take the cold. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> asks why he joined the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> as he is afraid of everything. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> tells him that on his eighteenth nameday his father offered him a choice. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> was a man and his heir, but he was not skilled at combat, he was unworthy of his name and birthright. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>wall's father forced him to join the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, and told him that if he refused, he would arrange a "hunting trip" with his son in the woods, and implied that <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> would be killed in a way that looked accidental. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is shocked that a true born son of high birth should be treated worse than he himself had been as a bastard. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> knows that the next day he will be made to fight again and expects it to be bad.
<en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> yields to <en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en>.  At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> orders the recruits to go easy on <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>, but <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> refuses, saying that if <en name='Alliser' type='person'>Ser Alliser</en> orders him to fight '<en name='Lady' type='other'>Lady</en> <en name='Piggy' type='other'>Piggy</en>', he will slice himself off a side of bacon. In response to <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en>'s comments, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> goes to his bed that night and uses his direwolf <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en> to intimidate <en name='Rast' type='other'>Rast</en> into playing along. The next day, no one will fight <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en>. After <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> takes a very weak blow from <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> and yields, <en name='Alliser' type='person'>Ser Alliser</en> scolds <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> for his rebellious actions. Later, when <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> are cleaning the dining hall, they talk about how neither of them have been with a woman. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> tells <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that he has not had success with girls, while <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> reveals he'd rather not risk siring a child that will have the life of a bastard like himself. A furious <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='other'>Alliser Thorne</en> comes in and tells <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that this charity won't help <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> harden up to survive the winter that is coming. He tells them the truly horrific experience he went through trapped by a blizzard north of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> that ended in cannibalism.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
<en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en>'s khalasar arrives at <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en>, the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> city. There are no city walls, but there is a large gateway arch made of two statues of rearing horses. <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> is annoyed that <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> has been taking 'his' army in the wrong direction. Later, he bathes with <en name='Doreah' type='other'>Doreah</en> and tells her about how he was raised with stories about the <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> dragons and his own destiny. He recites the names of several dragons, and tells her about the skulls of dragons that once decorated the throne room at <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, but she starts to annoy him with talk of dragons, reminding him that they are dead. He tells her to finish pleasuring him in silence.
<en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> is enraged when <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> sends <en name='Doreah' type='other'>Doreah</en> with an invite for him to dine with her, as he interprets this as his sister commanding him to come. He drags <en name='Doreah' type='other'>Doreah</en> into <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en> tent, and insults her dinner and the gifts of clothes she tries to give him. He is still dressed in his now ragged clothes from <en name='Pentos' type='place'>Pentos</en>, having refused to dress like a <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en>, whom he regards as savage pordh. He sneers that next she will try to braid his hair like a <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en>. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> retorts that he has no right to braid his hair until he is victorious in battle, which further infuriates him. In his anger, <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> tackles her to the ground and tries to strike her, calling her nothing but a "horselord's slut", and warning her that she's "awoken the <en name='Dragon' type='other'>Dragon</en>", but this time she fights back, hitting him in the face with a metal and leather belt. She tells a thunderstruck <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> that she is the <en name='Khal' type='other'>Khal</en>'s wife, and is carrying his child (and by implication, <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> is nothing to the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en>), and warns that if he raises a hand against her again, he will lose his hands. Later, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> confides in <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> her realization that <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> will never become <en name='King of Westeros' type='other'>King of Westeros</en>. He is so weak and ineffectual that he couldn't command an army even if <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> gave him one, to which <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> agrees.
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
In the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> visits the <en name='Great Hall' type='other'>Great Hall</en>, where the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> sits. She and <en name='Mordane' type='person'>Septa Mordane</en> discuss the expectation that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> will have to provide <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> with an heir. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> thinks the realm will hate her if she only has daughters, along with her belief <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is still angry over the incident by the river and her anger at her father over <en name='Lady' type='other'>Lady</en>'s death.
The small council meets.  During a meeting of the small council, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> learns that the forthcoming tournament to celebrate his appointment is seeing the city swell with visitors, and has already resulted in a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race. He tells <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> that money will have to be found to strengthen the city guards, as well as giving twenty of his own men to <en name='Janos Slynt' type='other'>Janos Slynt</en>'s command, until the tournament is over. After the meeting <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> talks to <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> about <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>'s last few weeks. <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> said he did all he could to save <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>, but the illness was sudden and severe. He recalls that shortly before his sudden illness, <en name='Arryn' type='other'>Arryn</en> had borrowed a truly boring book about the lineages of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>, and his last words were, "The seed is strong."
Taking the book with him, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> comes across <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> in the hall standing on one leg as part of her training with <en name='Syrio' type='other'>Syrio</en>. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> asks whether <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> would be able to live in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> with them now that he's awoken, but <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> states that he would have to regain his strength first. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> then comments that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> had always wanted to be a knight in the <en name='King 's Guard' type='other'>King 's Guard</en>, but will no longer be able to due to his paralysis. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> confirms this to be the case, but states that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> will be able to do many other things such as become lord of a holdfast, sit on the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en>'s council, or raise castles. When <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> asks if she would be able to become any of those, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> instead tells her that she will marry a highborn lord and have lords and princes for sons. However, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is not pleased with this response, telling her father, "that's not me." She goes back to balancing on one leg as <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> looks on.
<en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> talks with <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>.  <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> meets with <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> and suggests that he keep his investigation into <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>'s death lower in profile. He also gives <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> some interesting intelligence: <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>'s former squire has been knighted and will fight in the forthcoming <en name='Hand' type='other'>Hand</en>'s tourney. He also advises him to investigate an armorer located in the city. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> decides that <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> may be more trustworthy than he first thought, but <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> discourages him from thinking that way. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> sends <en name='Jory Cassel' type='other'>Jory Cassel</en> to question <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>'s former squire, <en name='Hugh of the Vale' type='person'>Ser Hugh of the Vale</en>. However, deducing that <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en> was not a knight, <en name='Hugh' type='person'>Ser Hugh</en> simply rebuffs him and refuses to speak with him due to his much lower rank. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s investigation leads him to a smithy in the city, where he meets master smith <en name='Tobho Mott' type='other'>Tobho Mott</en> and his apprentice <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en>, whose work <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> was also apparently interested in. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> realizes that <en name='Gendry' type='other'>Gendry</en> is one of <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s bastard sons, but can't work out why <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en> would be interested in this: <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> has many bastard children and shows little interest in any of them.
Later, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> sends <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en> with a message for <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>, but upon arriving at his quarters, the sounds of many women can he heard coming from <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>'s chamber. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Ser Jaime Lannister</en> happens to be on duty and is angry that the king keeps him guarding his chamber while he cavorts with other women inside, flaunting his dishonorable treatment of <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s sister in his face. He and <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en> reminisce about the <en name='Greyjoy Rebellion' type='other'>Greyjoy Rebellion</en>, in which they both fought for <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>'s forces to put down an attempt by <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon Greyjoy</en> (<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>'s father) to secede the <en name='Iron Islands' type='other'>Iron Islands</en> from the rest of the realm. <en name='Jory' type='other'>Jory</en> tries to leave <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s message with <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, but is rebuffed, as <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> angrily states that he does not serve <en name='Stark' type='person'>Lord Stark</en>.     <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Mordane' type='person'>Septa Mordane</en> at the tournament.  The tournament begins and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> watches from the stands. <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor Clegane</en>, the elder brother of <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en>, the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>, takes the field. His first joust is with <en name='Hugh' type='person'>Ser Hugh</en>. However, the friendly joust turns nasty and <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en> kills <en name='Hugh' type='person'>Ser Hugh</en> "by accident", with a splinter of the lance impaling his neck. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> sits next to <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, and remarks that she and <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> have had a lover's quarrel (as <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is still giving her the cold shoulder). <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en> then tells <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> that <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en>, the "<en name='Mountain That Rides' type='other'>Mountain That Rides</en>", has a dark reputation: he pushed his little brother <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en>'s face into a fire for taking and playing with a toy of his when they were young, burning him severely. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> recommends that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> not spread that story around.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> visits <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> at his chambers, remarking at how the <en name='Hand' type='other'>Hand</en> is not at his own tournament. Though <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> attempts to start the conversation in an attempt to put the incident on the <en name='Kingsroad' type='other'>Kingsroad</en> behind them, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> correctly deduces that she has an ulterior motive for her visit. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> then wonders aloud to <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> what his true purpose is for being at <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, as she knows how little <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> enjoy being in the capital. When <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> tells her he is to faithfully serve their <en name='King' type='other'>King</en>, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> remarks that as his brother <en name='Brandon' type='other'>Brandon</en> was born to lead, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> was born to follow.
In the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>
At the <en name='Crossroads Inn' type='other'>Crossroads Inn</en>, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and <en name='Rodrik Cassel' type='person'>Ser Rodrik Cassel</en>, on their way home to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, are enjoying the hospitality of the innkeeper and, more reluctantly, the attempts by the troubadour <en name='Marillion' type='other'>Marillion</en> to ingratiate himself with them. (He is doing a poor job: when he asks if they would like a song, he is refused.) They are surprised when <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en> and <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en> arrive. When told there aren't any rooms, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> holds up a gold coin and asks if someone has a room for him. Quickly <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> gains the favor of a sellsword, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>, who agrees to give his room to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>. <en name='Marillion' type='other'>Marillion</en> draws the attention of <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s table, by offering to serenade him while he eats, singing of his father's military victories. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says nothing would more likely ruin his appetite, but as he is turning away, he recognizes <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and is surprised at this meeting by chance. In return <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> tells the stunned inn that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> tried to murder her son <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> twice and that she asks their help in bringing him to the king's justice. The inn is located in the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en>, in the territory controlled by her father, so the knights present owe him their fealty. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> finds himself surrounded by half a dozen men with swords, and in <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en>'s custody.
