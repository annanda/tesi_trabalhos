In the aftermath of <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>'s capture, <en name='Syrio' type='other'>Syrio</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> face off against <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guards, while <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> manipulates <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to her own ends. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> rallies his father's northern bannermen against <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> and heads south to war. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> forms an uneasy alliance with the hill tribes and reunites with his father. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> lashes out at <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Ser Alliser Thorne</en> and battles a mysterious attacker from beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> is forced to reconcile her desire to conquer <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> with <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s savagery after the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> raid a peaceful village.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> return to <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> with their party and two dead bodies in tow. The two corpses are identified as members of <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen Stark</en>'s missing ranging party, <en name='Jafer Flowers' type='other'>Jafer Flowers</en> and <en name='Othor' type='other'>Othor</en>. Though the deceased appear to have been dead for some time, <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> astutely notes that the bodies do not smell like they have been rotting. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and several other <en name='Sworn Brothers' type='other'>Sworn Brothers</en> urge <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Lord Commander Jeor Mormont</en> to burn the bodies, but he refuses, wanting <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> to examine them..
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is summoned to <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en>'s chambers as news has arrived of <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s arrest and imprisonment. After being given the letter to read for himself, a speechless <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> attempts to leave before <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> reminds him of the oath he has sworn to the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. When <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> expresses concern for his sisters, <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> replies he is sure they are unharmed, though <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is doubtful.
Later on, <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='other'>Alliser Thorne</en> taunts <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that his father is a traitor, calling him, "not just a bastard, a traitor's bastard." <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> angrily charges at him with a knife and <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> is only saved by <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> and <en name='Pyp' type='other'>Pyp</en> holding <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> back. <en name='Mormont' type='person'>Commander Mormont</en> witnessed the incident and confines <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to quarters for his trouble. That night, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is aroused by a whining <en name='Ghost' type='other'>Ghost</en> scratching at the door. Sensing trouble, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and his direwolf head to the <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en>'s chambers where <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is confronted by a wight, the reanimated corpse of the dead <en name='Night 's Watchman' type='other'>Night 's Watchman</en>. Though <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is able to stab the wight through the chest with his sword, the wight simply removes the sword and is unharmed. <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> appears, seeking out the commotion. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> grabs <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en>'s oil lamp and throws it at the wight, finally destroying it.
The morning after, the two wight bodies have been thoroughly burned. <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> says he read in a book that the dead are animated by the touch of the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> and only fire can destroy such creatures. He hopes the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> is big enough to hold them back when the <en name='Walkers' type='other'>Walkers</en> come in force.
In the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>
At the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>, <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> is furious with <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en>: first for <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> not immediately notifying her about <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s arrest and second for refusing to consider summoning the knights of the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> to war. Despite setting in motion this chain of events with her letter to her sister regarding the murder of <en name='Jon Arryn' type='person'>Jon Arryn</en>, <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> does not believe that war is in the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>'s best interests and rather want the knights to stay in the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> to protect her son and their <en name='Lord' type='other'>Lord</en>.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> have reached the western edge of the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en> and are surrounded by members of the hill tribes, led by a fearsome warrior named <en name='Shagga' type='other'>Shagga</en>. At first he orders them to be killed, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> does some fast-talking and convinces the hill tribes that <en name='House Lannister' type='house'>House Lannister</en> is an enemy of the <en name='House Arryn' type='house'>House Arryn</en> and its rulers. He proposes an alliance which will allow the tribes to enact vengeance against <en name='House Arryn' type='house'>House Arryn</en> and take ownership of the lands of the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>. They eagerly agree, and escort <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> westwards towards where the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> armies are gathering.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
Dozens of ravens leaving <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, summoning the banners of the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> to war.
<en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> receives a letter from <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, asking him to pledge fealty to <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en>. <en name='Maester' type='other'>Maester</en> <en name='Luwin' type='other'>Luwin</en> correctly deduces the letter is actually the work of the <en name='Queen' type='other'>Queen</en>. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> refuses to consider the request and sends out ravens, summoning the lords bannermen of the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> and their armies to assemble at <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. Released ravens fill the sky.
At <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> holds a feast for several of his newly-arrived bannermen. <en name='Jon Umber' type='person'>Jon Umber</en> assumes that he will lead the vanguard, and is offended by the suggestion that he would be made to march behind a <en name='Glover' type='other'>Glover</en>, threatening to withdraw from the host. In response, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> promises that, after the conflict with the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>, he will oust <en name='Greatjon Umber' type='person'>Greatjon</en> from his keep and hang him for breaking his oaths to <en name='House Stark' type='house'>House Stark</en>; when the enraged bannerman goes to draw a weapon, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s direwolf <en name='Grey Wind' type='other'>Grey Wind</en> sets upon him, biting off two of his fingers. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> recites 'that it [is] death to bear steel against your liege lord' but then diffuses the situation by excusing <en name='Greatjon Umber' type='person'>Greatjon</en>'s aggression, saying that 'doubtless, the <en name='Greatjon Umber' type='person'>Greatjon</en> only meant to cut my meat for me'. <en name='The Greatjon' type='other'>The Greatjon</en> roars with laughter and accepts <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s commands, much to the shock of <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, who witnessed the entire incident. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> says farewell to <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and to <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>, who is convinced he'll see neither <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> nor his parents again.
<en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> prays by the heart tree when he is approached by <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> who tells him the <en name='Old Gods of the Forest' type='other'>Old Gods of the Forest</en> are listening to him and that the wildlings also worship the <en name='Old Gods' type='other'>Old Gods</en>. She laments that the <en name='South' type='other'>South</en> has lost touch with the past; the southern <en name='Weirwoods' type='other'>Weirwoods</en> were cut down years ago and the <en name='Southerners' type='other'>Southerners</en> have no idea what's awakening in the north. They are interrupted by <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> who was bathing and has forgotten to put his clothes back on, and <en name='Osha' type='other'>Osha</en> remarks that he might have giant blood in him before <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> sends him away. Curious, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> asks her if giants live beyond the wall. She affirms they do, as well has many other beings, though not all of them are friendly. She asserts that the army <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> has gathered should be marching north, not south.
<en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and <en name='Rodrik Cassel' type='person'>Ser Rodrik Cassel</en> intercept <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>'s army in the <en name='Neck' type='other'>Neck</en> as it presses southwards. <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> initially exclaims with excitement upon seeing his mother, but stops short of embracing her lest he look weak in front of his bannermen. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> looks at her son with understanding, later embracing once their liege-lords have left their tent. She tells <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> he has no choice but to go to war. However, he cannot lose, for the sake of <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en>, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, as if he is defeated, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> will show their family no mercy.
Later on, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> and his lords are debating on the route of their march, and on whether to march directly against <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s army or against <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s army besieging <en name='Riverrun' type='place'>Riverrun</en>. To get to <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, they need to cross the <en name='Green Fork of the River Trident' type='other'>Green Fork of the River Trident</en>, and the only crossing is at the <en name='Twins' type='other'>Twins</en>, held by the notoriously prickly and easily-offended <en name='Walder Frey' type='person'>Lord Walder Frey</en>. A <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> scout is captured, and <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> sends him back to warn <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin</en> that twenty thousand <en name='Northern' type='other'>Northern</en> soldiers are marching against him.
At the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> Camp
<en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en> and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> greet <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and his companions.  <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>, <en name='Shagga' type='other'>Shagga</en> and the rest of the hill tribesmen arrive at the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> encampment, to find <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin Lannister</en> and his brother, <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Ser Kevan</en>, planning to engage the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> army, which is moving south from the <en name='Neck' type='other'>Neck</en>. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> shows no sign of relief that his son is alive. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> accepts the aid of the hill tribesmen, but <en name='Shagga' type='other'>Shagga</en> will only fight if <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> fights alongside them, a prospect which <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> welcomes and terrifies <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>.
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
<en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> disciplines <en name='Mago' type='other'>Mago</en>.      <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> notes <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s injury.  In <en name='Essos' type='other'>Essos</en>, <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> having taken an oath to take the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>, has begun his march of conquest to the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>. <en name='The Dothraki' type='other'>The Dothraki</en> raid a village in <en name='Lhazar' type='other'>Lhazar</en>, a peaceful country to the south-east of <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en>. To finance the war to come, they must raid villages and take people to sell into slavery, thereby gaining the money to hire ships for the khalasar to assault <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah</en> and others try to explain this to <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, but she is disturbed to see the aftermath, the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> killing the villagers and raping their women, and orders it stopped. <en name='The Dothraki' type='other'>The Dothraki</en> grow angry at not being able to take the spoils of victory, as that is the <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> way. She starts claiming all the women they see to protect them. The angry warriors take their complaints to <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en>, but he is amused at his wife's fierceness. He tells them that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> may keep the women she has claimed, they can find others. One man won't listen, and angrily accuses <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> of being slave to a foreign whore. <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> stops the complaints by killing <en name='Mago' type='other'>Mago</en>, the offended warrior who challenges him. <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> takes a deep wound to the chest in the process. Though <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en> dismisses it as a scratch, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> insists it be treated and allows one of the women she rescued, a healer called <en name='Mirri Maz Duur' type='other'>Mirri Maz Duur</en> to treat the wound, despite the distaste of <en name='Drogo' type='other'>Drogo</en>'s bloodriders, who derisively call the woman maegi (a witch).
In <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> soldiers complete their purge of the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> guards and household staff. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Mordane' type='person'>Septa Mordane</en> hear sounds of fighting. When they are confronted by <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guardsmen led by <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en>, <en name='Mordane' type='person'>Septa Mordane</en> tells <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to run and lock herself in her room while she stays to confront them. However, <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> later finds and takes <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> into custody.
<en name='Syrio Forel' type='other'>Syrio Forel</en> confronts <en name='Meryn Trant' type='person'>Ser Meryn Trant</en> and <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guards.
More <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> guardsmen, this time led by <en name='Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard' type='person'>Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard</en>, interrupt a "dancing" lesson between <en name='Syrio Forel' type='other'>Syrio Forel</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>. <en name='Syrio' type='other'>Syrio</en> holds <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> back, questioning why <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard</en> would send <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> men to find <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>. She then refuses to go with them, and when they try to force the issue <en name='Syrio' type='other'>Syrio</en> disarms and disables all of the lightly-armored guardsmen with his wooden practice sword. He tells <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> to run as he faces down <en name='Trant' type='other'>Trant</en>, noting that for himself, "the <en name='First Sword of Braavos' type='other'>First Sword of Braavos</en> does not run." <en name='Syrio' type='other'>Syrio</en>'s fate after this is unclear.
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> runs to the stables where the men waiting with their baggage were supposed to be to take them to the ship for <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>. The men are dead, but she finds her real sword, <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en>, in the bottom of her trunk. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> then starts to leave the stables. (<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> knows how to get out of the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en> via the tunnel under the castle that she found when she was chasing cats and followed the two conspirators). When a stableboy tries to grab her, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> turns around brandishing <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en> and accidentally runs him through and kills him. Horrified, she flees.
<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> visits <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en> in his cell in the dungeons. He is incredulous that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> trusted <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> over him, and even more so that he warned <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> what he was going to do. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> says he wanted to extend mercy to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s children, whom <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> would have killed if he'd known the truth. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> bluntly tells <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> that his mercy is what killed <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en>, to <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s shame. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> then tells him that <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> also no longer holds <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> as her prisoner, meaning that the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> have nothing to barter with for <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s life. When <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> suggests they should just kill him, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> says "Not today, my lord." As he departs, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> asks <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> who he truly serves: <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, in a rare display of honesty, replies "The realm, my lord. Someone must."
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and the remainder of the small council, comprised of <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en>, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, and <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>, summon <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to inform her that her father has been arrested for treason. They manipulate <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> into writing a letter to her brother <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, asking him to bend the knee peacefully to <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>. They add that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s fate may depend on what his son and the other <en name='Northern' type='other'>Northern</en> lords do. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> agrees to write the letter.
Later on, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en> holds court in the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>. <en name='Janos Slynt' type='other'>Janos Slynt</en>, commander of the <en name='City Watch' type='other'>City Watch</en>, is to be made <en name='Lord of Harrenhal' type='other'>Lord of Harrenhal</en> as a reward for his loyal service. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> then dismisses <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Ser Barristan Selmy</en> as head of the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en>, noting that the time has come for an honorable retirement. <en name='Selmy' type='other'>Selmy</en> is confused, pointing out that <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> serve for life, but <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> angrily says that <en name='Selmy' type='other'>Selmy</en> is too old, and couldn't protect his father. <en name='Selmy' type='other'>Selmy</en>'s disgrace is only compounded when he learns his post as <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en> is to be given to <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en>, much to his disgust. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> announces that <en name='Selmy' type='other'>Selmy</en> is to be given a castle and land in recognition of his years of service, but the old knight, insulted by what he sees as being offered "a hall to die in and men to bury me," takes off his armor, throws his sword at <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s feet and storms out, stating that he could still kill all five of the other <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> present with ease.
<en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> begs <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> for her father's life, claiming that the medicine he was taking for his injured leg was responsible for his treasonous talk. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> says that her sweet words have moved him and he will spare <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>, if he bends the knee to him and acknowledges him as king. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> says he will.
