The royal party reaches <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. Almost immediately, <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Lord Eddard Stark</en> is asked to attend a meeting of the king's small council and to change his clothes, but he refuses to the latter. Before that he encounters <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en> in the throne room. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is still unhappy that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> judged him dishonorable for killing the <en name='Mad King' type='other'>Mad King</en>, the murderer of <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s father and brother. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is unrepentant about it. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> meets the council members: <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Lord Petyr</en> "<en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>" <en name='Baelish' type='other'>Baelish</en>, the king's <en name='Master of Coin' type='other'>Master of Coin</en> and a friend of <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s wife from childhood; <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en>, the king's adviser in all matters scientific and academic; <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Lord Renly Baratheon</en>, the youngest of the king's two brothers and <en name='Master of Laws' type='other'>Master of Laws</en>; and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, a eunuch and the <en name='Master of Whisperers' type='other'>Master of Whisperers</en> (the head of the king's intelligence network).
<en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> tells <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> that the council members heard about his "troubles on the <en name='Kingsroad' type='other'>Kingsroad</en>" and that they pray for <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s recovery. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> grimly responds "It's a shame no one prayed for the butcher's boy", which visibly upsets <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> is stunned to learn that the crown is six million <en name='Gold Dragons' type='other'>Gold Dragons</en> in debt, half of which is to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin Lannister</en>. To make matters worse, <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>King Robert</en> has just ordered a lavish tournament to celebrate <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en>'s appointment. He resolves to advise <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> to cancel the tournament, but the council is doubtful that the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en> will listen.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and her son <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Cersei</en> talks to <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> about the incident on the river. She tells him that when he is king, the truth will be whatever he decides it will be. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> thinks there will be trouble with the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en>, and promises that when he is king, he will double their taxes, force them to contribute to a standing army and, should they object, crush them and install someone loyal, such as his great-uncle <en name='Kevan Lannister' type='person'>Kevan</en>, as <en name='Warden of the North' type='other'>Warden of the North</en>. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> points out that the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders, and a king needs to be more clever. She also advises him to be kind to his betrothed <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en> to avoid stirring up trouble for later, and concludes that "<en name='Anyone' type='other'>Anyone</en> who isn't us is an enemy."
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> are still at odds over the incident with <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and her direwolf. <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> explains that <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> was put in a difficult position by the king and queen, and while she shouldn't have lied, winning the long-term approval of <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, her future husband, was important. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is unhappy with the situation, but <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> mollifies her by allowing her to practice with her sword, <en name='Needle' type='other'>Needle</en>.
<en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and <en name='Rodrik' type='other'>Rodrik</en> arrive in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>.  <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn Stark</en> and <en name='Rodrik' type='person'>Ser Rodrik</en> arrive at <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and attempt to sneak into the city, but are spotted by one of <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en>'s men. They are taken to meet <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> at a brothel he owns, where <en name='Varys' type='person'>Lord Varys</en> is also waiting: one of his 'little birds' told him they were coming. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> is angered by the way they've been treated, but asks <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> for aid in finding the people who tried to have <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> killed. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> is able to answer this quickly: the elaborate dagger wielded by the assassin used to be his, but he lost it in a gamble with <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion Lannister</en>.
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> threatens <en name='Baelish' type='person'>Lord Baelish</en>.
<en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> fetches <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> to meet his wife, but <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> suspects a trick and pushes <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> up against a wall outside the brothel wanting to know what his game is. <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> then appears, and <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> is pacified. After hearing her news, he vows to find the truth and expose the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> to <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en>. <en name='Littlefinger' type='other'>Littlefinger</en> agrees to be his ally in this, for the affection he once bore <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> as a youngster.
<en name='Raven' type='other'>Raven</en>s arrive at <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> with news of <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s recovery. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> fears he will expose their secret, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> comforts her.
<en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> comforts <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>.
Elsewhere, <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> swaps old war stories with <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Ser Barristan Selmy</en>, a distinguished and famous knight and the commander of the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en>. Summoning <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en>, <en name='Robert Baratheon' type='person'>Robert</en> jokingly questions him about <en name='Aerys Targaryen' type='person'>Aerys Targaryen</en>'s death, wondering if the <en name='Mad King' type='other'>Mad King</en> died begging for mercy, but <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he'd been saying since the siege of <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> began: "Burn them all".
<en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> has contracted a swordmaster, <en name='Syrio Forel' type='other'>Syrio Forel</en>, the former <en name='First Sword of Braavos' type='other'>First Sword of Braavos</en>, to teach <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> how to use her sword properly. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> is thrilled, and 'the dance' begins. As <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> watches them practice, his pleasure at seeing <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> happy sours when he realizes that a conflict between the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> and <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en> may be inevitable; his daughter may well be training herself for war.
In the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>
<en name='Old Nan' type='other'>Old Nan</en> tells <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> of winter and the <en name='Long Night' type='other'>Long Night</en>.

She instead speaks of the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> and the coming of a vast winter that will blanket the world.

At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>
At <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, the primary redoubt of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> in the shadow of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> shows his worth to the trainer, <en name='Alliser Thorne' type='person'>Ser Alliser Thorne</en>, by besting several fellow members of the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en> in the practice yard. <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> is disgusted at the poor performance of the others but has no praise for <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> either, dubbing him <en name='Snow' type='person'>Lord Snow</en> and describing him as "the least useless person here". <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>ing over the new recruits with <en name='Lord Commander' type='other'>Lord Commander</en> <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor</en> <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> notes <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en>'s stern and unusual ways, but <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor</en> doesn't care as he only requires <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en> to turn the "thieves and runaways" into men of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>. Later on, several of the other recruits gang up on <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, but the situation is defused by <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> points out to <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that none of the other recruits had the benefit of a skilled master-at-arms to train them, and that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is alienating them through his standoffish attitude and superior combat skills.
<en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen</en> talks with <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> on the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>.
<en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen Stark</en> meets <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> atop the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and tells him he is going on a ranging in the <en name='Haunted Forest' type='other'>Haunted Forest</en>. He refuses to take <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> with him, telling him he isn't ready, and that here rank and nobility mean nothing: every man must earn everything he gets. Before departing, <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen</en> stops by the eating area to farewell <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en>, a fellow <en name='Night 's Watchman' type='other'>Night 's Watchman</en> who scouts for new recruits in the capital. <en name='Benjen Stark' type='person'>Benjen</en> also scolds <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> for his naivety regarding what is north of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and states that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> has no authority to say what is or isn't beyond the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> as he hasn't been out there himself.
Later, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> discusses north of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> with <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor</en> <en name='Mormont' type='other'>Mormont</en> and his chief adviser, the ancient and blind <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en>. <en name='Jeor Mormont' type='person'>Jeor</en> asks for <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to intercede at court and get the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en> more men as they are dangerously undermanned. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> warns that the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> words are right: a terrible winter is coming and more dangerous things than just wildlings might come with it; after all, one of their number swore that the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> had returned ... right up to the moment <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned Stark</en> cut his head off. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> admits his skepticism that supernatural creatures might exist, but he agrees to bring word to his queen.
Before departing for <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> fulfils an old ambition by climbing to the top of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and urinating off the edge of it. He and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> share a moment of fellowship before <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> departs for the capital in the company of <en name='Yoren' type='other'>Yoren</en>.

He is strangled by <en name='Rakharo' type='other'>Rakharo</en>, a <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> warrior wielding a whip. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> calms the situation and <en name='Viserys Targaryen' type='person'>Viserys</en> is forced to walk, a sign of shame amongst the horse-riding <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en>. Later, <en name='Irri' type='other'>Irri</en> reveals to <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is pregnant. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> relays the news to <en name='Drogo' type='person'>Khal Drogo</en> and tells him she thinks it will be a boy as they lie naked in each other's arms. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Ser Jorah Mormont</en> and <en name='Rakharo' type='other'>Rakharo</en> compare the <en name='Westerosi' type='other'>Westerosi</en> and <en name='Dothraki' type='other'>Dothraki</en> ways of battle; the heavily-armored but slow knights versus the lightly-armored but fast-moving horse-warriors. <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> has heard of <en name='Rakharo' type='other'>Rakharo</en>'s father, a great warrior, but admits that he disgraced his own father, a man of great honor. When he learns that <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is pregnant, he announces he must split off from the column to ride to the <en name='Free City of Qohor' type='other'>Free City of Qohor</en>, but will rejoin them before they reach <en name='Vaes Dothrak' type='other'>Vaes Dothrak</en>.
