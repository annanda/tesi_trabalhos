At <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>
In his cell, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> discuss <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s fate and the irony of <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Lord Tywin</en> striking down both his heirs if <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> were to die being <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s champion; <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> declines to be <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s champion as he cannot fight well enough with his left hand. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then requests <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> to bring him <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>, hoping the sellsword will stand for him just as he did at the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>.

He refuses to fight the <en name='Mountain' type='other'>Mountain</en> (whom <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> has chosen for her champion), both for lack of a reward and believing <en name='Clegane' type='other'>Clegane</en> is too dangerous for him to face, and bids farewell to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, who while heartbroken by <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en>'s decision, understands.
<en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> visits <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> in his cell.
Later, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is approached by <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn Martell</en>, who tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> of his disappointment in their first encounter: as children, <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> and his sister <en name='Elia Martell' type='person'>Elia</en> were told stories of the "<en name='Lannister Monster' type='other'>Lannister Monster</en>" and his extreme deformities. During a childhood visit to <en name='Casterly Rock' type='place'>Casterly Rock</en>, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> showed <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, with great ceremony, to <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> and <en name='Elia Martell' type='person'>Elia</en>. <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he saw no monster, just a baby. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> told <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> and his sister that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> killed her mother, and then cruelly assaulted <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> until <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> stopped her. <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> says that he and <en name='Elia Martell' type='person'>Elia</en> were quite disturbed at <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s already strong hatred toward <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, who is disturbed by <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s relentless hatred as his eyes tear up. <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he seeks justice for the death of his sister, and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> replies, "You are in the wrong place." <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> counters that he is in the perfect place; all those he means to bring to justice for his sister's murder are close at hand. Intending to start his revenge with <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor Clegane</en>, <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn</en> offers his service as <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s champion in the coming trial by combat.

She feigns outrage at the intrusion, but agrees to hear his complaints. <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> laments that he is only good at two things, killing men and sleeping with women, and that he has no opportunities to pursue either strength. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> counters that the <en name='Second Sons' type='other'>Second Sons</en> are currently acting as <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>'s police force and that there are many women in the city who would throw themselves at him; <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> dismisses the <en name='Second Sons' type='other'>Second Sons</en>' role as unchallenging and says the only woman he wants isn't interested.

She also says to let <en name='Daario' type='other'>Daario</en> know that it was <en name='Jorah Mormont' type='person'>Jorah</en> who changed her mind.

She quips that the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> told her to enjoy it as it was the last time she would have a good bath, but the joke goes over <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en>'s head. To cement <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en>'s position as <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en>'s most devoted follower, the <en name='Red Priestess' type='other'>Red Priestess</en> tells her about using potions and illusions in serving the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> and that a bit of pageantry and deception in helping converts see the truth will be forgiven later on. <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en> asks her if she used the potions when she slept with <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>, to which she replies that she did not. <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en> then remarks on her desire to leave their daughter <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en> behind when they go to the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> but <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> is as dismissive about <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en>'s "heresy" as she always is, and assures <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en> that <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en> will be needed where they are going.

He is denied after being reminded of his place in the <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>, when the <en name='First Builder' type='other'>First Builder</en> reluctantly agrees with <en name='Thorne' type='other'>Thorne</en>'s assessment of their chances of defending the tunnel. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and <en name='Sam' type='place'>Sam</en> are sent to serve as sentries on top of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> until <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> arrives.

Afterward, <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> clumsily addresses his wounds from <en name='Biter' type='other'>Biter</en>. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> suggests burning to cauterize the wound, but is rebuffed by <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en>'s fear of fire. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> confirms the story of his facial scars from burns inflicted by <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en>'s wrath and how his father covered up the truth, making him feel alone. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> offers to clean and stitch him up, and <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> allows her to.
Meanwhile, <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> and <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> stop at an inn where they are served kidney pie made by none other than <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en>, who proceeds to tell them at length the process in finding the right ingredients. He then asks of <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>'s business, to which she replies that she is in <en name='Stark' type='person'>Lady Stark</en>'s service to find and protect <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>. <en name='Hot Pie' type='other'>Hot Pie</en> leaves after addressing the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en> as traitors.

He tells them that he knows nothing of <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, but has seen her sister <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> alive, along with the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> is surprised because <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> has been presumed dead since she disappeared when her father <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en> was executed. They deduce that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>'s captors are probably going to try to ransom <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> somewhere. Having memorized the complex family trees of the <en name='Great Houses' type='other'>Great Houses</en>, <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> surmises that <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>'s aunt <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa Arryn</en> is the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>'s only remaining chance of a reward for her.

The cousins get along until <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> asks where the <en name='Moon Door' type='other'>Moon Door</en> is. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> tells him <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> doesn't need a <en name='Moon Door' type='other'>Moon Door</en>. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> agrees to add one, but in the process, <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> accidentally knocks over a tower. <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> insists she replicate the tower. This irritates <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> throws a tantrum in response. Unable to control her anger, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> slaps <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en>. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> immediately softens and tries to apologize, but before she can <en name='Robin Arryn' type='person'>Robin</en> threatens to tell his mother and runs away. <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr Baelish</en> witnesses the action and assures <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> that he will deal with <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en>, whom he says should discipline her child more often, anyway. <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> muses on how he should have been <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>'s father, but then tells <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> that she is more beautiful than her mother <en name='Catelyn Stark' type='person'>Catelyn</en> and kisses <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>; who is so shocked that she doesn't resist.

<en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> is pushed out the <en name='Moon Door' type='other'>Moon Door</en>.

She is stopped when <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> arrives and swears by everything he can think of that he will send <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> away. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> releases <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and embraces <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en>, who assures <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> that he only ever loved one woman - her sister. <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> has only an instant to contemplate this betrayal, as <en name='Petyr Baelish' type='person'>Petyr</en> shoves her out of the <en name='Moon Door' type='other'>Moon Door</en> and looks down as she plummets to her death hundreds of feet below.
