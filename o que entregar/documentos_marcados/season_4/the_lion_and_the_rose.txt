A who's who of honored guests turns out for <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>'s wedding in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. Meanwhile, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> gives a lesson to an unlikely pupil; <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s vision helps map out his journey; <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> loses patience with <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en>; and <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> takes a perverse delight in his new pet.
At <en name='Dragonstone' type='place'>Dragonstone</en>
On the beach of <en name='Dragonstone' type='place'>Dragonstone</en>, <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> presides over a public burning ceremony, setting three people chained to stakes ablaze as an offering to the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en>. One of the condemned is <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Queen Selyse Baratheon</en>'s own brother <en name='Axell Florent' type='person'>Axell Florent</en>, condemned for his lack of faith in the <en name='Lord' type='other'>Lord</en>'s power. <en name='Watch' type='other'>Watch</en>ing the proceedings, <en name='Davos Seaworth' type='person'>Ser Davos Seaworth</en> holds his tongue, though his disgust both for the ritual and <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> are plain. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> is surprisingly silent throughout the proceedings; it is <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en> who takes the greatest pleasure in the ritual.
Afterwards, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> and <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en> eat dinner, with <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> as a guest at their table. The royal couple argue over their daughter, <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Princess Shireen Baratheon</en>; <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en> believes the girl's disfigurement is a punishment from the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en>, but <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> angrily forbids his wife from trying to physically chastise their daughter for her perceived faults. <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Selyse</en> switches tactics and suggests that <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> speak to <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en>. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> doesn't protest, but <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> doesn't look particularly interested in the task. Nonetheless, <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> does speak with <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en>, who heard the death of her uncle from her bedroom window, explaining in gentle yet matter-of-fact terms that the <en name='Faith of the Seven' type='other'>Faith of the Seven</en> and its holy books are lies: <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> insists there are only two gods, the <en name='Lord of Light' type='place'>Lord of Light</en> and the <en name='Great Other' type='other'>Great Other</en>, constantly at war. When <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Shireen</en> asks if there is any truth to the <en name='Faith' type='other'>Faith</en>'s belief in seven heavens and seven hells, <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> replies "There is only one hell... the one we live in now".
At the <en name='Dreadfort' type='other'>Dreadfort</en>
In the forests surrounding the <en name='Dreadfort' type='other'>Dreadfort</en>, the seat of <en name='House Bolton' type='house'>House Bolton</en>, <en name='Ramsay Snow' type='other'>Ramsay Snow</en> hunts a peasant girl for his sport, accompanied by <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en> (whom <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> now addresses by his new name, <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>) and <en name='Myranda' type='other'>Myranda</en>, along with a pack of savage dogs. The girl is eventually brought down and torn to pieces by the dogs, much to <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en>'s horror.
Soon after, <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose Bolton</en> arrives at the <en name='Dreadfort' type='other'>Dreadfort</en> accompanied by a detachment of his army, including <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> and <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en>'s new wife, <en name='Walda Bolton' type='person'>Walda Bolton</en>. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> greets his father and his new step-mother (as well as privately congratulating <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> for his maiming of the <en name='Kingslayer' type='other'>Kingslayer</en>). <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> wants to see <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>'s captive <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon Greyjoy</en>.
<en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> is brought to <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en>'s chambers, where <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> is disgusted and angered to learn <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> has tortured and flayed <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en>; as <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon Greyjoy</en>'s sole surviving male heir, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> was a valuable hostage. <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> notes that while he has been named <en name='Warden of the North' type='other'>Warden of the North</en>, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> will not help him reclaim the north from the ironborn, and he had intended on trading <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> for <en name='Moat Cailin' type='other'>Moat Cailin</en>, a strategically placed fortress on the border between the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> and the <en name='Riverlands' type='place'>Riverlands</en> currently held by <en name='Greyjoy' type='other'>Greyjoy</en> forces, preventing the main <en name='Bolton' type='other'>Bolton</en> army from returning north. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> retorts that he already sent terms and <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon</en> refused him. <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> is furious that <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> did so without his consent, but <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> demonstrates that his actions have made <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> docile and unable to betray them.
After ordering <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> to shave him, <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> cajoles him into admitting that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon Stark</en> are still alive. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> reminds his father that the boys are now heirs to <en name='House Stark' type='house'>House Stark</en>'s rule of the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> following <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>'s death, and nearly all the <en name='Northerners' type='other'>Northerners</en>, who are furious at <en name='House Bolton' type='house'>House Bolton</en> and <en name='House Frey' type='house'>House Frey</en>'s treachery against the <en name='Starks' type='other'>Starks</en>, will rally behind <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>Â rather than <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> if they learn the boys are alive. <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en>, knowing how close <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> was to <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, gleefully taunts him by revealing details of the <en name='Red Wedding' type='other'>Red Wedding</en>, particularly relishing the fact that it was <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> who personally murdered <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>. Despite being clearly shaken to know the man he considered a brother is dead at the hands of his new masters, <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> does not openly react.
<en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> dispatches <en name='Locke' type='other'>Locke</en> with orders to find and kill <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> and <en name='Rickon Stark' type='person'>Rickon</en>; <en name='Reek' type='other'>Reek</en> suggests that <en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> might either be sheltering the boys at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en> or at least may know where they have gone, while <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> advocates killing <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> as well, given that the fact he has <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> blood could lead to him becoming a threat, since the <en name='Northeners' type='other'>Northeners</en> will rally behind him or he will simply seek revenge (although harming <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> would constitute a grave crime since he is part of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> and thus legally untouchable by the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>). <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> gives <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> orders as well; to take <en name='Theon Greyjoy' type='person'>Theon</en> and an army to <en name='Moat Cailin' type='other'>Moat Cailin</en> and reclaim the fortress from the <en name='Greyjoys' type='other'>Greyjoys</en>. If he succeeds, <en name='Roose Bolton' type='person'>Roose</en> will give consideration to legitimizing <en name='Ramsay Bolton' type='person'>Ramsay</en> as a member of <en name='House Bolton' type='house'>House Bolton</en>.
<en name='Beyond the Wall' type='other'>Beyond the Wall</en>
We follow the point of view of a panting figure traveling through a dark, snow-covered forest. It kills a deer. Just as the figure makes its kill, it is revealed that the figure is <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> and that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en> had been warging into <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s warging is interrupted by <en name='Meera Reed' type='other'>Meera Reed</en>, who says that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> had been gone for hours. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> is not happy about having been snapped out of his warging, saying that he was eating. <en name='Jojen Reed' type='other'>Jojen Reed</en> clarifies that <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> was eating and that what <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> cannot gain sustenance from what <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> eats. <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> and <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> also caution <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> that warging so long is dangerous for other reasons. Even though it allows <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> the mobility he lost when he was injured, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> would become trapped, forgetting his friends, his family, his home, and even himself. And if <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> forgets himself, they all lose everything.
The group breaks camp and continues traveling through the forest. They eventually come upon a weirwood tree. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> has <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> take him to the tree. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> touches the tree just under the face carved into it and sees a vision. Several images rush to <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>'s mind, including swarms of crows, wights (both human and horses), and the fall that paralyzed him. He also sees the <en name='Three-eyed' type='other'>Three-eyed</en> raven taking flight in a darkened corridor and later land on a tree. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> sees his father sharpening <en name='Ice' type='other'>Ice</en>, in the <en name='Black Cells' type='other'>Black Cells</en>, and being led to his execution; the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en> abandoned and covered in snow; and the shadow of a dragon flying over <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> also sees several images of a different weirwood tree located on top of an otherwise barren mountain. During the vision, a gravely voice tells <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> to "look for me beneath the tree... NORTH." <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> snaps out of his vision out of breath, but then matter-of-factly states, "I know where we have to go."
At <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en>
Over a meal, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> discuss <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>'s gilded steel hand, and he discloses to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he can no longer fight, as all of his instincts are wrong using his left hand. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is perturbed that people will find out that he cannot fight so <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> tells him that he needs to train with his left hand with someone trustworthy in order to better protect the king, as the <en name='Lord Commander of the Kingsguard' type='other'>Lord Commander of the Kingsguard</en>.
<en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> presented before <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en> and <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Queen Margaery</en> at their wedding.
Later, <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> waits in a courtyard by the sea for his training partner that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> has arranged. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> emerges with two training swords. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> remarks that he hasn't wielded a sparring sword since he was nine. As they commence training, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> uses his usual dirty tactics and gets the better of <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, teaching him not only to use his offhand, but encouraging him to fight dirtier.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> finds <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> on his way to a breakfast celebration on the day of <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s wedding. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> divulges that <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> has been spotted and that his sister, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, has been notified. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> then says that there is nothing he can do to protect <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> any longer in fear of <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en>, the <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en>, or <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> finding out that he has been lying to them. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> then says that <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> will not leave <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> and is warned that <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> has threatened to hang the next whore <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is seen with.
The dais set up for the royal wedding.
At the breakfast celebration, <en name='Mace Tyrell' type='person'>Mace Tyrell</en> gifts <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> a magnificent golden chalice with seven facets, one for each of the major houses in the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en> and wishes he and his daughter, <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery Tyrell</en>, a long and happy marriage. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> graciously accepts. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> spots <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> and tells <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> that she is <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s whore, and he commands for her to be sent to the <en name='Tower of the Hand' type='other'>Tower of the Hand</en> before the wedding. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> overhears this and looks vexed, but proceeds to approach <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en>, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s squire, presents him with the <en name='Lives of Four Kings' type='other'>Lives of Four Kings</en>, a book detailing the reigns of four kings by <en name='Grand Maester Kaeth' type='other'>Grand Maester Kaeth</en>. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> accepts the gift but his sincerity seems questionable. A member of the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> then presents a <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> steel sword and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> tells him that it is one of two swords of its kind in the capital, and <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> rushes to wield it. He promptly begins to slash at <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s gift despite its rarity, and then asks for suggestions on its name from guests in attendance. He settle on the name <en name='Widow 's Wail' type='other'>Widow 's Wail</en>.
After the breakfast, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is visited in his chambers by <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> and he informs her that there is a ship waiting for her bound for <en name='Pentos' type='place'>Pentos</en> and that their "friendship" is at an end. <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> pleads to stay, but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says he is married and it is too dangerous for her to stay.
<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is poisoned and killed.
When <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> enters and tries to escort her out, she slaps him and runs away. When <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> later asks <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> if she is gone, he says that she boarded the ship. When <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> asks if he saw it sail away, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> assures him that no one has been following him while escorting her, that she is gone and no one knows about it except the two of them and <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>. He then advises <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to go and drink until it feels like he did the right thing.
<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>'s wedding ceremony takes place in the <en name='Great Sept of Baelor' type='place'>Great Sept of Baelor</en>Â conducted by the <en name='High Septon' type='other'>High Septon</en> and they are wed in front of gods and men. At his wedding feast, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>King Joffrey</en> speaks to the crowd about contemplating history. Out of a large golden lion, five dwarves ride out, representing <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly Baratheon</en>, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en>, <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb Stark</en>, and <en name='Balon Greyjoy' type='person'>Balon Greyjoy</en>, each of the five kings in the <en name='War of the Five Kings' type='other'>War of the Five Kings</en>. The dwarves put on a performance, jousting, fighting, and making crude sexual acts. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, his brother <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>, andÂ <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>Â laugh at the performance. <en name='The Tyrells' type='other'>The Tyrells</en> (<en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en>, <en name='Mace Tyrell' type='person'>Mace</en>, and <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>), as well as <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Prince Oberyn</en>, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>,Â <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>,Â and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>, make little effort to hide their disgust. <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en> leaves in anger after watching the crude depiction of his deceased lover <en name='Renly Baratheon' type='person'>Renly</en> (riding a mount resembling <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>), and <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> looks on in obvious grief when the dwarf playing her brother <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en> is killed after having his wolf's head knocked off. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> expresses his delight with the play and prepares to give the champion dwarf a purse but then mockingly suggests that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> fight him as well. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> cleverly counters this jape by suggesting that <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> should fight instead and show the same bravery he displayed at the <en name='Battle of the Blackwater' type='place'>Battle of the Blackwater</en>, cautioning his nephew to be careful as the champion dwarf is "clearly mad with lust" and it would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night. This draws a few stifled chuckles from their guests. Enraged and humiliated that his uncle outwitted him in front of all his wedding guests, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> petulantly pours wine over <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s head and orders him to serve him wine as his cupbearer.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> approaches <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>, who then purposely drops the goblet and kicks it under the table. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> hands the goblet to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, and he fills it with wine and hands it back to <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>. The king demands that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> kneel before him but <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> refuses. <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> interrupts the tense moment and says it is time to cut the pigeon pie. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> hands the goblet to <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en>, who then places it at the edge of the table near her grandmother <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en>. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> draws his new sword, cuts the pie, and several white doves fly out.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> cries over her sons murder.
<en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> and <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> attempt to leave the feast, while <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> serves <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> a piece of pie. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> commands <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to serve him wine to wash down the pie. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> hands the goblet to <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> and he quickly drinks all of it. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> tries to speak, but begins coughing. He grabs his throat, and <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and <en name='Olenna Tyrell' type='person'>Olenna</en> exclaim that he is choking and needs help. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> collapses face down and begins vomiting and convulsing. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> and <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> rush in and turn <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> over on his back. <en name='Dontos Hollard' type='other'>Dontos Hollard</en> suddenly approaches <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> from behind and says she must come with him quickly, and she does. <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> points an accusatory finger in <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s direction, as he examines the wine goblet (though it is not made clear if <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> is accusing <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> or merely the wine). <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s eyes turn red, blood runs from his nose, he stops convulsing, and dies. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> sobs with grief and orders the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en> to seize <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> for the poisoning of her son.
