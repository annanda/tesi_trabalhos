Circumstances change after an unexpected arrival from north of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>. <en name='Dany' type='other'>Dany</en> must face harsh realities. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> learns more about his destiny. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> sees the truth about his situation.
At the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, and <en name='Beyond' type='other'>Beyond</en>
<en name='Jon Snow' type='other'>Jon Snow</en> emerges from the outer gate of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and begins trudging north through the aftermath of the previous night's battle towards <en name='Mance Rayder' type='other'>Mance Rayder</en>'s war camp. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> eventually reaches the tree line and is quickly surrounded by wildlings, who bring him before <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>, who notes that he is wearing the black of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> again. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> brings <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> inside his tent, and questions his status as a traitor. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> confesses that his time spent with the wildlings was all part of a plan orchestrated by <en name='Qhorin Halfhand' type='other'>Qhorin Halfhand</en> to get <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to infiltrate <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>'s army, and that <en name='Qhorin' type='other'>Qhorin</en> tricked <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> into trusting <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> by allowing <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> to kill <en name='Qhorin' type='other'>Qhorin</en> himself in a fight. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> asks about <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> reveals that she died at the <en name='Battle of Castle Black' type='other'>Battle of Castle Black</en>, though not by his hands. Saddened, <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> proposes that they drink a toast to her memory, but <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is hesitant when given an unfamiliar drink. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> accepts after <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> assures him that if he'd wanted to kill <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>, poison would be the last of his methods. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> then asks about the giant who got through the gate but never came out, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> informs <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> that the giant perished attempting to breach the inner gate at the hands of his friend <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en>. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> ruefully notes that the giant was named <en name='Mag the Mighty' type='other'>Mag the Mighty</en>, and he was "king" of the giants, the last of a bloodline stretching back thousands of years before the <en name='First Men' type='other'>First Men</en> entered <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en>, to which <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> then glibly notes that his friend <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en> was from a farm. They have another toast to <en name='Mag' type='other'>Mag</en> and <en name='Grenn' type='other'>Grenn</en>.
<en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> then proposes his terms to <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>: <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> is to turn his army around and return home. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> immediately counters that the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> is low on oil, arrows, and men, and when he sent his full force against the <en name='Wall the Night 's Watch' type='other'>Wall the Night 's Watch</en> threw everything they had at him to repel the attack. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> guesses there are no more than 50 men left guarding <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, but <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> lies and insists that there are still over 1,000 men defending the garrison. However, <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> calls <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en>'s bluff and reveals that after seeing how few men were defending <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, he sent 400 men about five miles west to climb an unmanned section of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, and they will attack <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>'s weak southern side as soon as he gives the order. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> then changes his demeanor and reveals that his people have suffered enough bloodshed and that he has no intention of conquering the lands south of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>; that the wildlings are moving south to seek refuge from the growing threat of the <en name='White Walkers' type='other'>White Walkers</en> just as those south of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> are. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> then makes his counteroffer: if the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> will open the gates to the wildlings and allow them to pass through the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, no more harm will come to the black brothers. However, if his terms are refused, his wildling army will slaughter every last member of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> and move south by force.
<en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> then notices that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> is eyeing a cooking knife, and quickly deduces that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> came to parley with <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> simply so he could assassinate him. He notes that at that moment his personal guards are far enough across the room that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> might actually be able to kill him before being cut down himself, but that <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> must have known he would die assassinating <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> is shocked and questions <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> if this is what the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> has sunk to: killing a man who let him into his own tent, accepting a parley in good faith, who shared food and drink with him, and who even offered him (relatively) reasonable peace terms. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> hesitates, but before anyone can make a move, war horns are heard from outside. <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>'s guards safely grab <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> during the distraction, and <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> demands to know if the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> is attacking them, but <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> admits that it's just as <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> said: the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> doesn't have remotely enough numbers to leave the safety of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and attack.
Columns of heavy horse carrying hundreds of mounted cavalry charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of <en name='House Baratheon of Dragonstone' type='house'>House Baratheon of Dragonstone</en>, and are led by none other than <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis Baratheon</en> and <en name='Davos Seaworth' type='other'>Davos Seaworth</en>. The wildlings are caught in their own camp, resting from the battle the night before and only expecting attacks from the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, so their eastern flank is completely undefended. As they are undisciplined and have no experience fighting heavily armored cavalry, they are quickly dispatched by <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en> riders, who attack the wildling camp from both sides in two separate columns that catch the wildlings in a perfect double envelopment. Quickly cutting the wildling forces down, <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> and <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> ride up to <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>, who throws down his weapons in surrender, officially ending the wildlings' siege of <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>.
<en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> introduces <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> as the true king of the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>, but <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> wryly points out that they are not currently in the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> demands that it is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king. Resignedly, <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> says that the <en name='Free Folk' type='other'>Free Folk</en> do not kneel, knowing that <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> will kill him if he does not. <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en>, however, asks what a man of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en> is doing in the camp, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> explains that he came to treaty with the <en name='King-Beyond-the-Wall' type='other'>King-Beyond-the-Wall</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> says that he knows that <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> is the true king, as his own father died supporting his claim, revealing himself as the bastard son of <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard Stark</en>. This makes <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> regard <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> more seriously. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> proclaims that <en name='Eddard Stark' type='person'>Eddard</en> was an honorable man, and asks <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> what <en name='Ned Stark' type='person'>Ned</en> would have done with <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> responds that <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> could have killed him or tortured him when he was his captive but instead he spared his life, so instead of killing <en name='Mance' type='other'>Mance</en> he should be taken prisoner and interrogated. Before they leave the wildling camp, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> also urges <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> to burn the dead before nightfall.
<en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> looks through the flames, and sees <en name='Snow' type='other'>Snow</en>.
Back at <en name='Castle Black' type='place'>Castle Black</en>, a funeral is held for the slain members of the <en name='Night 's Watch' type='place'>Night 's Watch</en>, who have been arranged in a huge funeral pyre in the castle courtyard. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> delivers a eulogy, saying that they died to protect the men, women, and children of the south who will never even know who they were, that it is the duty of the surviving black brothers to keep alive their memory. <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> closes his speech with the customary line, "and now their watch has ended," which is repeated by the gathered men. <en name='Samwell' type='other'>Samwell</en> then aids <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> in setting the pyre alight, which is continued by <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> and other men carrying torches. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> and <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en> look on, along with <en name='Selyse Baratheon' type='person'>Queen Selyse</en> and <en name='Shireen Baratheon' type='person'>Princess Shireen</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> looks across the flames and catches the gaze of <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en>, who is standing on the opposite side of the pyre. <en name='Melisandre' type='place'>Melisandre</en> seems intrigued, her piercing stare clearly making <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> uneasy.
Afterwards, <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> enters the chamber of the castle where <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> is being held. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> asks why blind old <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Maester Aemon</en> patched up his arrow wounds, and <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> says that <en name='Aemon Targaryen' type='person'>Aemon</en> is sworn to heal all wounded men, friend or foe. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> asks if <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> really loved <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en>. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> doesn't respond. <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> says that <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en> truly loved him, and that he knew because although she never admitted it, she talked only of killing him, revealing her true feelings for him (if she hadn't loved him, she wouldn't have been so angered by his betrayal). Saddened, <en name='Tormund' type='other'>Tormund</en> implores <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> that <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en>'s final resting place should be in "the real north." <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> then takes <en name='Ygritte' type='other'>Ygritte</en>'s corpse to the north side of the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en> and builds a funeral pyre for her near a sacred <en name='Heart' type='other'>Heart</en> tree. <en name='Jon Stark' type='person'>Jon</en> looks at his lover one last time and lights her pyre, and weeps silently as he turns his back and heads home.
Far to the north, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran Stark</en> and the <en name='Reed' type='other'>Reed</en> children continue their journey to find the <en name='Three-eyed' type='other'>Three-eyed</en> raven, though they are on the brink of exhaustion. <en name='Jojen Reed' type='other'>Jojen Reed</en> has grown sick and and he is barely able to stand, eventually collapsing into the snow. As <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> begs <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> to gather what little strength he can muster to continue forward, <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> calls out to them, revealing that they have found the massive heart tree that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> has seen in his visions. As they approach the tree, wights burst up from the snow, grabbing <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en>'s ankles and attempting to drag him under the ice. These wights appear far older than those seen near the <en name='Wall' type='place'>Wall</en>, appearing as ghastly skeletal warriors who move with surprising agility. <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> attempts to defend <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> from the wights, but they begin to swarm over <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>, who is too scared to fight back. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> wargs into <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>'s mind and begins fighting off the wights with the aid of his direwolf <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en>, but more wights keep bursting through the ice and they are quickly overwhelmed.
Just as all seems lost, the wights around <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> suddenly burst into fireballs, and he hears a young girl's voice calling to him from a cave entrance at the base of the heart tree. Amidst the confusion <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> is repeatedly stabbed by a wight before <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> can fight it off. The mysterious girl calls to <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> and says that <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> is lost and that she must leave him if she wants to live. <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> hesitates, but <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> urges her to save herself. Crying, <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> slits her brother's throat to grant him the mercy of a quick death. <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> runs to the cave entrance along with <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en>, <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en>, and <en name='Summer' type='other'>Summer</en> while the mysterious child covers their retreat by magically throwing fireballs from her hands at the wights. Just as the life drains from <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en>'s eyes, she launches a fireball at his body, immolating his corpse and preventing his return as a wight (and fulfilling <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en>'s vision that his death would involve fire).
They run into the cave, pursued by the wights, who instantly shatter upon crossing the threshold of the cave. The little girl explains that the power which animates the dead corpses is powerless inside the cave. When <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> asks who she is, she replies that "the <en name='First Men' type='other'>First Men</en> called us 'the <en name='Children' type='other'>Children</en>, but we were born long before them." <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> realizes that she is one of the last surviving members of the <en name='Children of the Forest' type='other'>Children of the Forest</en>, the original, non-human inhabitants of <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> who carved the faces into weirwood trees and taught the <en name='First Men' type='other'>First Men</en> to worship the <en name='Old Gods' type='other'>Old Gods</en> thousands of years ago.
The child leads them deeper into the cave, which is overgrown with white weirwood roots from the massive tree above. Other <en name='Children of the Forest' type='other'>Children of the Forest</en> peek out around corners as they advance. Finally, they arrive at a large central chamber, its floor littered with bones. In the middle of the cave is an old man seated in the middle of weirwood roots, which have grown around and even through much of his body. <en name='Hodor' type='other'>Hodor</en> places <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> on the ground and <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> crawls towards the old man, asking if he is the <en name='Three-eyed' type='other'>Three-eyed</en> raven who appeared in his visions. The old man admits that he is, having taken several forms in the past, but his true form is before them now. <en name='Meera' type='other'>Meera</en> is upset that her brother died to reach him, but the <en name='Three-eyed Raven' type='other'>Three-eyed Raven</en> says that <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> (who possessed the <en name='Greensight' type='other'>Greensight</en>, as <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> does) always knew that he would die helping <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> arrive here, but that he came nonetheless. He informs them that he has been watching all of them throughout their entire lives "with a thousand eyes, and one." He continues by stating that <en name='Jojen' type='other'>Jojen</en> died so that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> could come here and regain what he has lost. <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> asks if he means he will regain the use of his legs. <en name='The Three-eyed' type='other'>The Three-eyed</en> raven replies that <en name='Bran Stark' type='person'>Bran</en> will never walk again, "but you will fly."
Across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en>
In <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Queen Daenerys Targaryen</en> sits in her throne room where she is receiving the day's supplicants. An old man named <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en> approaches the throne, first speaking in <en name='High Valyrian' type='other'>High Valyrian</en> but then revealing that he also knows the <en name='Common Tongue' type='other'>Common Tongue</en>. <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en> explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor, but a well-educated teacher and servant to <en name='Master Mighdal' type='other'>Master Mighdal</en>, who employed him as a teacher for his own children. He tells <en name='Daenarys' type='other'>Daenarys</en> that <en name='Master Mighdal' type='other'>Master Mighdal</en>'s seven year old daughter <en name='Calla' type='other'>Calla</en> admires <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en>, having learned of the <en name='Targaryen' type='other'>Targaryen</en> dynasty through <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en>'s teachings.
As a servant of Master <en name='Mighdal' type='other'>Mighdal</en>, <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en> was well-treated and even well-respected in the household, but when <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full-scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people. <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en> originally stayed in <en name='Master Mighdal' type='other'>Master Mighdal</en>'s house after she took the city, and <en name='Mighdal' type='other'>Mighdal</en>'s children begged him to stay, but <en name='Mighdal' type='other'>Mighdal</en> and <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en> agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals, forcing <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en> to become homeless. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to house them. Fennez says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe: the young prey on the old, assaulting and robbing them. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> insists that her <en name='Unsullied' type='other'>Unsullied</en> will restore order, but <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en> points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety, he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew. Therefore, he has come to <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> to beg her permission to sell himself back to <en name='Mighdal' type='other'>Mighdal</en>. She is shocked that he would want to be owned as a slave again, as a man might own a goat or a chair. He implores her that the young may rejoice in her new world, but for those too old to change, there is only fear and squalor. Nor, he says, is he alone: there are many supplicants waiting outside lining up to make similar requests.
<en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> is crestfallen, and says she did not liberate the slaves of <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en> only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy, but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one's own choices. Therefore she will allow <en name='Fennesz' type='other'>Fennesz</en> to enter into a labor contract with <en name='Mighdal' type='other'>Mighdal</en>, but lasting no more than one year. He earnestly thanks her, and leaves. <en name='Barristan Selmy' type='person'>Ser Barristan Selmy</en> warns <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> that the masters will assuredly take advantage of this, quickly making "contracts" with all of the displaced former slaves until they are all slaves again in all but name.
The next supplicant then enters, a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms, similarly to the herdsman who came to show the bones of their livestock which <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s dragons burned in order to be reimbursed. The shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> to translate. Distraught, he tells <en name='Daenarys' type='other'>Daenarys</en> that the "winged shadow" came, placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred bones - of a human child. <en name='Daenerys'' type='other'>Daenerys'</en>s largest dragon - the black one, <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> - has roasted the man's three year old daughter <en name='Zalla' type='other'>Zalla</en> until this is all that was left of her. Horrified, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> meets with <en name='Missandei' type='other'>Missandei</en> and <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> in private to discuss how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of <en name='Meereen' type='place'>Meereen</en>. <en name='Grey Worm' type='other'>Grey Worm</en> reports that <en name='Drogon' type='other'>Drogon</en> was last seen flying over the <en name='Black Cliffs' type='other'>Black Cliffs</en> three days ago, but he can no longer be found. Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city. Later, she leads her remaining two dragons, <en name='Rhaegal' type='other'>Rhaegal</en> and <en name='Viserion' type='other'>Viserion</en>, into the catacombs, where they are distracted by sheep carcasses. As they are feeding, <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> personally locks huge iron collars around their necks, which are secured by heavy chains. She weeps as she does so, as it is symbolically reducing her remaining "children" to chained-up slaves themselves. <en name='Daenerys Targaryen' type='person'>Daenerys</en> wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place.
In the <en name='Seven Kingdoms' type='other'>Seven Kingdoms</en>
In <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en>'s laboratory in <en name='King' type='other'>King</en>'s Landing, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en>, and <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> stand over <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor Clegane</en>, who lies immobilized on a flat wooden table and is revealed to be suffering from a massive wound centered around his right side. <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> informs <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> that <en name='Oberyn Martell' type='person'>Oberyn Martell</en> had coated his spear with manticore venom, poisoning <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Ser Gregor</en>. The effects are horrific, with <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en>'s wounds putrefying and creating a terrible stench. <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> says that he is beyond any hope of recovery, but <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> insists to <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> that he can save him using more unorthodox methods. <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> chaffes at his suggestion, stating that he is not even a maester, and that such arrogance is what led to <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en>'s expulsion from the <en name='Citadel' type='other'>Citadel</en> in the first place, for experiments that were deemed both dangerous and "unnatural." <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>, determined to save <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en> from death, dismisses <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en> and orders <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> to do whatever is necessary, infuriating <en name='Pycelle' type='other'>Pycelle</en>, who angrily shuffles out of the laboratory. She asks <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> if his treatment will work, and <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> claims that if his past work is any indicator, he stands a chance at saving <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en>. <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> states that the process will "change" him, although <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> seems only concerned with whether it will weaken him, to which <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> replies "Oh no." <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> leaves, and <en name='Qyburn' type='other'>Qyburn</en> begins syphoning out <en name='Gregor Clegane' type='person'>Gregor</en>'s tainted blood.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> approaches <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> and insists that she will not submit to a forced marriage to <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Ser Loras Tyrell</en>. He attempts to dismiss the subject by stating that the matter is closed, but she persists and says that it is not just because she does not love <en name='Loras Tyrell' type='person'>Loras</en>: he wants to ship her off to <en name='Highgarden' type='other'>Highgarden</en> and remove her from the court entirely, keeping her away from her last remaining son. With <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> out of the picture, both <en name='Margaery Tyrell' type='person'>Margaery</en> and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> will attempt to get their claws into <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>, each trying to manipulate him into their allegiance. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> refuses to budge, so <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> plays her trump card: she threatens to destroy <en name='House Lannister' type='house'>House Lannister</en> by telling everyone the truth. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> seems confused, and at first <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> scoffs that he is merely feigning ignorance. With growing realization, she assesses that even the brilliant <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin Lannister</en> never noticed what was going on between his own children, when all it would have taken was one attentive moment in the past twenty years. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is still apparently confused, so with a merciless grin <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> reveals that all of the rumors about her and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> (and their children) are true  -  she will tell everyone and destroy <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s vaunted family legacy, even though it will also mean her death and <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en>'s death. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> shakes with barely constrained rage, but in denial he accuses that <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> is simply lying to anger him. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> says she doubts he truly thinks that and leaves him standing in his chamber alone.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> finds <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> in the <en name='White Sword Tower' type='other'>White Sword Tower</en>, and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> killed. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> asserts that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> killed their mother when she gave birth to him. <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that, pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened. He insists that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is her family, whether she chooses to accept it or not. She rebukes his claim, saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice, and that she chooses <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>. She then reveals that she has spilled their secret to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>. He is stunned and concerned by her actions, asking how <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> reacted to the news, but she states that she does not want to discuss their father. She begins to seduce him, saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world, no longer concerned with whether anyone else knows their secret. He yields to her advances, kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex.
In the middle of the night, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is awoken in his cell by the sound of his cell door being opened by <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, who reveals that he has orchestrated an escape plan for <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> with the assistance of <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, who has secured a galley in the harbor on which <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> can sneak out of the city and flee to the <en name='Free Cities' type='place'>Free Cities</en>. He leads <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to a stairway leading up to a locked door, instructing <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, who will lead him to the ship. Before they part ways, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> and <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes, unsure if either will ever see the other again.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, alone, stares at the door at the top of the staircase, ultimately deciding to use the secret passages of the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en> to infiltrate the <en name='Tower of the Hand' type='other'>Tower of the Hand</en>. He enters the <en name='Hand of the King' type='other'>Hand of the King</en>'s quarters, and sees a woman lying in <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s bed, with <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s clothes folded up on a chair. As he draws closer he sees that the woman is <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>, who thinks it is <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> and calls out for him, calling him "my lion" as she had once done to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>. When she turns over and sees that it is <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, looking utterly betrayed, she grabs a knife to defend herself. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> could retreat but instead he rushes forward onto the bed to wrestle it from her grasp. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> manages to knock the knife from her hands and the two continue to struggle violently until <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> manages to grab the necklace around her throat (which he once gave her as a gift) and strangles her with it. He continues to strangle her long after she has stopped resisting, until she is dead. He sinks to the floor and sits next to <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>'s lifeless body, weeping, and tells her he's sorry. He stares at the wall across the room and sees several weapons on display, among them <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en>'s old crossbow, and his expression quickly darkens.
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> takes the crossbow down from the wall, loads it, and heads down the hall to the privy, opening the door to find his father seated upon the toilet. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> seems surprised to see <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, but quickly regains composure and asks <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> to lower the crossbow. He correctly deduces that <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en> helped <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> escape his cell, telling <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that they can discuss the matter back in <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s chambers. However, when he attempts to stand, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> steadies the crossbow, stopping him dead in his tracks. "All my life you've wanted me dead," <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> states, and <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> acknowledges the validity of his claim. He attempts to defuse the situation by telling <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that despite this, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> has stubbornly clung to life, which <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> states he finds admirable and insists that he was never going to have <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> actually killed. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> admits that he just murdered <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> with his bare hands, but <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> scoffs that it doesn't matter as she was nothing more than a whore. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is angered by <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s indifference and raises the crossbow, threatening that if his father says the word "whore" one more time he will kill him. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> balks that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> won't kill his own father in the privy, and again tries to convince <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that they should continue to discuss this in his chambers. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> says he cannot go back to <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s chambers because <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>'s body is still there. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> dares <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> by calling his bluff and mocking him by saying "because you're afraid of a dead whore?"
<en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> was not bluffing. The moment <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> utters the word "whore" again, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> looses his crossbow bolt, hitting <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> in the belly and knocking him backwards. <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> is incredulous that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> actually had the courage to fight back against him, and that he will die in such an undignified way at the hands of his hated dwarf son. As <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> reloads the crossbow, <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en> angrily declares that <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is no son of his. "I am your son," <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> replies quietly, "I have always been your son," and fires a second bolt into <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s heart, killing him. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> discards the crossbow as he leaves to find <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en>, who immediately realizes <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> has done something terrible, exclaiming "What have you done?" Nonetheless, he leads <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> out of the castle to the docks where <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is stowed away inconspicuously in a crate aboard the ship. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> begins walking back towards the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en> but stops when he hears the bells begin to toll, signaling the discovery of <en name='Tywin Lannister' type='person'>Tywin</en>'s body. Realizing that returning to the castle is likely unsafe, <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> turns around and heads back for the ship, sitting next to <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s crate in silence as they cast off for <en name='Essos' type='other'>Essos</en>.
In the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>, <en name='Brienne of Tarth' type='other'>Brienne of Tarth</en> and <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en> are heading towards the <en name='Bloody Gate' type='other'>Bloody Gate</en> when they happen upon <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya Stark</en> practicing her water dancing while <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> is off relieving himself, both returning from the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en> after receiving words of <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa</en> <en name='Arryn' type='other'>Arryn</en>'s death. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> and <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> converse for a moment, both showing respect for one another as they are both women who have fought against what has been expected of them their entire lives. They are interrupted by the return of the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>, who is immediately recognized by <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en>, causing <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> to realize that the girl is <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> tells <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> of her sacred vow to protect her mother, although she failed to do so because she was sent by her mother to return <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime Lannister</en>. <en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> immediately accuses <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> of working for the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>, noticing her <en name='Valyrian' type='other'>Valyrian</en> steel sword  <en name='Oathkeeper' type='other'>Oathkeeper</en>, which <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> admits was given to her by <en name='Jaime Lannister' type='person'>Jaime</en>, frightening <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> into thinking that <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> is working for the <en name='Lannisters' type='other'>Lannisters</en>. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> implores <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> to come with her to safety, causing the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> to mock <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en>, pointing out that there is no "safety" for <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> anymore: her aunt <en name='Lysa Arryn' type='person'>Lysa Arryn</en> in the <en name='Eyrie' type='place'>Eyrie</en>  -  whom <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> and <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> are seeking out  -  is dead, as are her father, mother, and older brother, while the <en name='Stark' type='other'>Stark</en> armies are scattered and <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en> is a smoking ruin. They draw swords and begin fighting, both eventually disarming each other and resorting to brutally fighting each other in hand-to-hand combat. Ultimately, <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> gains the upper hand (by biting off a chunk of <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en>'s ear) and knocks him down a cliff side. <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> goes to search for <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en>, who slipped away during the melee and has hidden herself amongst the rock formations. As <en name='Brienne' type='other'>Brienne</en> and <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> search the surrounding area for <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> in vain, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> makes her way down the cliff side to find the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> badly wounded. He tells her that unless there is a maester miraculously on hand to tend to his wounds, he's finished. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> tells her to kill him and scratch another name off her list, but she just sits and stares at him silently. He grows angry and begins recounting running down the butcher's boy and how he should have raped <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> in <en name='King 's Landing' type='place'>King 's Landing</en> in an attempt to goad <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> into killing him in anger, but she remains silent. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> finally begs her to kill him and put him out of his misery, but she quietly refuses and takes his money purse, leaving him screaming at her to kill him as she silently walks away.
<en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> rides a horse to the nearby coast of the <en name='Vale' type='place'>Vale</en>, where she sees a wharf with ships docked. She approaches a captain and asks if she can pay for travel to the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en>, but he says that they won't go there because these days the <en name='North' type='place'>North</en> is full of war, cold, and pirates. Instead, the ship is going "home": to the <en name='Free City of Braavos' type='other'>Free City of Braavos</en>. <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> remembers the special coin that the <en name='Faceless Man' type='other'>Faceless Man</en> known as <en name='Jaqen H'ghar' type='other'>Jaqen H'ghar</en> gave her, and instructed her to present to any man from <en name='Braavos' type='place'>Braavos</en> if she needed aid. She does so now, and the captain is utterly surprised at how she obtained it, but she says only "<en name='Vala' type='other'>Vala</en>r morghulis" (as <en name='Jaqen' type='other'>Jaqen</en> instructed), to which the captain gives the traditional response, "<en name='Vala' type='other'>Vala</en>r dohaeris." He warmly welcomes her aboard the ship, and insists that she will have her own cabin. As the ship casts off, <en name='Arya Stark' type='person'>Arya</en> stands aboard the ship and watches as the shore of <en name='Westeros' type='place'>Westeros</en> shrinks further and further away. She then moves to the prow of the ship, looking forward across the <en name='Narrow Sea' type='other'>Narrow Sea</en> in the direction of the <en name='Free Cities' type='place'>Free Cities</en> and <en name='Braavos' type='place'>Braavos</en>.
