He spends the night before the expected siege in bed with <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>, telling her she can still leave the city. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> has <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> provide him with a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. <en name='Varys' type='place'>Varys</en> tells <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> that he is all that stands between them and defeat. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> drinks with the <en name='Lannister' type='other'>Lannister</en> men and has a confrontation with the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>, who is here first beginning to show the emotional and political fluctuations he will experience in the coming battle and which will shape his destiny for the rest of the series. <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> plans a naval assault aiming to overcome the city's small defensive fleet and land his troops at the walls of the city near the <en name='Mud Gate' type='other'>Mud Gate</en>.
<en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> fires the arrow that triggers the wildfire explosion.
From the battlements, <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> berates <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, demanding to know why his ships are not meeting <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s fleet. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> has anticipated his strategy and does not field his fleet. Instead he sends a single ship filled with <en name='Wildfire' type='other'>Wildfire</en> into the heart of <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s fleet, leaking the volatile substance over the surface of the water. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> has been awaiting <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s signal outside the city on the shores of the bay, and when <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> tosses a torch from the battlements, <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> fires a flaming arrow triggering a massive, massive aquatic explosion. The ensuing conflagration devastates <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s fleet and destroys the ship of his high captain, <en name='Davos Seaworth' type='other'>Davos Seaworth</en>, as well as killing <en name='Davos' type='other'>Davos</en>'s son, <en name='Matthos' type='other'>Matthos</en>.
<en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> breaks down.
<en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> responds by putting his men ashore inside row boats, landing further from the walls to avoid the still burning inner bay. With less protection for his troops he predicts that thousands will die. He leads the assault personally and is the first to reach the walls. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> orders <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor Clegane</en> to lead a sortie beyond the <en name='Mud Gate' type='other'>Mud Gate</en> to repel the attackers. <en name='Sandor Clegane' type='person'>Sandor</en> does as asked but is terrified by the fire and breaks down emotionally. <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Ser Lancel Lannister</en> accompanies him and is wounded by an arrow. <en name='Bronn' type='other'>Bronn</en> joins the fight in time to save the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en>'s life. <en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> retreats after losing half of his men and refuses to go out again. He demands wine and walks away from the battle and his place in the <en name='Kingsguard' type='other'>Kingsguard</en>, after saying in the presence of all, including the king, "Fuck the kings guard. Fuck the city. Fuck the king."
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Queen Regent Cersei Lannister</en> offers protection to the ladies of the court in <en name='Maegor 's Holdfast' type='other'>Maegor 's Holdfast</en>. She had earlier obtained <en name='Essence of Nightshade' type='other'>Essence of Nightshade</en> (which is deadly unless taken in tiny amounts) from <en name='Grand Maester Pycelle' type='other'>Grand Maester Pycelle</en> and keeps the headsman <en name='Ilyn Payne' type='person'>Ser Ilyn Payne</en> at her side at all times, preparing for the worst. She drinks wine heavily during the assault and seems, to simultaneously torment and mother her captive, <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa Stark</en>, with a sort of cynical feminism involving dire descriptions of the rapes that will occur if the city falls. She also begins to question <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en>, who seems to her perhaps an unlikely handmaiden. When <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> comes to tell her that <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> has reached the walls <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> orders him to bring <en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> back to the <en name='Red Keep' type='place'>Red Keep</en>, ignoring his protests that it would damage morale.

<en name='Joffrey Baratheon' type='person'>Joffrey</en> willingly leaves the defensive line with <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> and charges <en name='Mandon Moore' type='person'>Ser Mandon Moore</en> and <en name='Boros Blount of the Kingsguard' type='person'>Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard</en> to fight in the <en name='King' type='other'>King</en>'s name. The gold cloaks' morale is broken by his departure. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> steels himself to lead a sortie of his own. He rallies his men by telling them to fight for their city, their homes and their women, if not for their king and utters his famous line, "Those are brave men are knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!" He leads his men through the tunnels beneath the city and is able to defeat <en name='Stannis'' type='other'>Stannis'</en>s troops manning a battering ram at the <en name='Mud Gate' type='other'>Mud Gate</en>. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> is betrayed by <en name='Mandon' type='person'>Ser Mandon</en> while fighting against a group of reinforcements. <en name='Mandon' type='other'>Mandon</en> slashes <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> across the face with his sword. Before he can strike <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en> again, <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>'s squire <en name='Podrick Payne' type='other'>Podrick Payne</en> kills <en name='Mandon' type='person'>Ser Mandon</en> from behind with his spear. <en name='Tyrion Lannister' type='person'>Tyrion</en>, barely conscious and held by <en name='Podrick' type='other'>Podrick</en> watches a battleÂ that seems lost.

When <en name='Lancel Lannister' type='person'>Lancel</en> tries to be firm with her, <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> ignores his counsel, pushes him out of the way (deliberately causing him pain by hitting his injured side), and storms out. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> tries to keep up the morale of the other women, frightened by <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en>'s sudden departure. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> leads them in singing a hymn. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> has taken <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> to the throne room. She sits with him on the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en>, and tells him a story about a young lion and how it did not need to fear other beasts of the forest, the wolf and the stag. As she does this, she readies the poison for herself and for her son. <en name='Shae' type='other'>Shae</en> tells <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> to go to her chambers, lock herself in, and await <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>, as he would not harm her, but <en name='Ilyn' type='person'>Ser Ilyn</en> might. <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en> finds the <en name='Hound' type='other'>Hound</en> waiting in her room. He offers to take her north to <en name='Winterfell' type='place'>Winterfell</en>, but she says she will be safe there when <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en> takes the throne.
<en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> and <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> on the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> as the battle rages.
<en name='The Hound' type='other'>The Hound</en> scares <en name='Sansa Stark' type='person'>Sansa</en>, but tells her to look at him, saying that since the world is made up of killers like <en name='Stannis Baratheon' type='person'>Stannis</en>, her father, her brother <en name='Robb Stark' type='person'>Robb</en>, and he himself, she better get used to looking at them. Though he promises to protect her, she is still too afraid of him to go with him. <en name='Cersei Lannister' type='person'>Cersei</en> sits on the <en name='Iron Throne' type='place'>Iron Throne</en> and prepares to poison <en name='Tommen Baratheon' type='person'>Tommen</en> in order to prevent him from being taken captive.
